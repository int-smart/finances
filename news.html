Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products&#39;s shares have seen a decrease of 5.79% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector&#39;s gain of 7.36% and the S&amp;P 500&#39;s gain of 3.55%.

The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company&#39;s upcoming EPS is projected at $1.41, signifying a 0.71% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $88.31 billion, showing a 2.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.

Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $404.19 billion, indicating changes of +5.33% and +3.36%, respectively, compared to the previous year.

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts&#39; favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To take advantage of this, we&#39;ve established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.15% lower. Apple presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

In the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 28. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 11.06.

One should further note that AAPL currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.22. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company&#39;s anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday&#39;s trading, the Computer - Micro Computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.48.

The Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 39% echelons of all 250+ industries.</p>

Between March and May, a staggering 97% of Foxconn&#39;s $3.2 billion exports went straight to the U.S., compared to just 50% last year. The push isn&#39;t subtle: Apple has been flying out iPhone 13, 14, 16, and 16e models on chartered planes and pressing Indian officials to cut customs clearance at Chennai airport from 30 hours down to six.

This shift comes as Apple looks to de-risk from China ahead of what could be another round of sweeping tariffs. Donald Trump has floated a 55% duty on Chinese goods and slammed Apple&#39;s expansion into India, reportedly telling CEO Tim Cook, We are not interested in you building in India. India, meanwhile, is trying to dodge a separate 26% reciprocal tariff on top of its standard 10%. With the stakes this high, Apple&#39;s move to reroute its supply chain through India could be less about costand more about survival. It&#39;s also about time. Apple still sells 60 million iPhones a year in the U.S., with about 80% made in China.

Tata Electronics, Apple&#39;s smaller Indian partner, is also stepping up. Nearly 86% of its March and April shipments went to the U.S., up from 52% across 2024. Analysts at Counterpoint Research believe India-made iPhones could hit 2530% of Apple&#39;s global shipments this yearup from just 18% in 2024. But India&#39;s still an expensive bet. High import duties on components make local assembly far from cheap. Still, Apple appears willing to absorb the extra costs in exchange for agility. The numbers suggest this isn&#39;t a trial run. It&#39;s a full pivot.

The requests cover mobile phones, cases, battery chargers and wireless telephone services, as well as potentially retail stores. The applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office were filed on Thursday, according to a public database.

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“While a trademark filing doesn’t guarantee a product launch, the specificity of the applications points to serious consideration,” Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm, wrote in a blog post on Friday.

The filings suggest plans could be in the works for a Trump-branded mobile phone or service to compete with Verizon Communications Inc., AT&amp;T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., Gerben wrote.

“It would mark a significant expansion for Trump’s private business, which has historically focused on real estate, hospitality, and branded merchandise,” he said.

Liquid Glass is named with the idea that each window on a phone is like a pane of glass, see-through and somewhat reflective. It gives the screen a sleeker look, though in its developer beta, Apple hasn’t quite worked out the kinks of playing with opacity.

The Vision Pro wasn’t much of a commercial success — it cost $3,500, and unlike a computer, it isn’t something that has proven essential for our lives. But nonetheless, the UX design of the Vision Pro is impressive because it makes wearing a headset feel a bit less disorienting.

It can feel unnatural to be so immersed in virtual reality for an extended period of time, so Apple took advantage of its mixed reality capabilities by overlaying windows atop a user’s real-world surroundings, rather than a synthetic background.

Apple may not be able to convince people that they need a $3,500 headset, but to keep up with competitors like Meta’s Ray-Bans and Google’s renewed attempt at smart glasses, Apple needs to enter the arena of this lighter hardware. And one of Apple’s strengths as a company — something that sets it apart from Meta and Google — is that it’s known for elegant, modern designs (except for “the notch“).

According to reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, these glasses would have cameras, microphones, and speakers like its competitors. Siri — which is still awaiting its own makeover — would be built-in, and could assist with taking phone calls, playing music, live translation, and turn-by-turn directions. On a display, users would be able to see notifications, pictures, and other overlays.

If that’s the case, then Apple will need to master the style of these somewhat transparent design elements. If you’re wearing AR glasses and get some form of notification, you’d probably rather see that as something that blends into your surroundings, and not some giant colorful box that suddenly obscures your vision while you’re walking around.

We don’t know much about the rumored Apple AR glasses yet, but we’d be willing to bet we’ll see Liquid Glass in them.</p>

Despite these developments, Apple&#39;s share price moved by a modest 2% last week. This reflects the broader market dynamics, including the Dow&#39;s significant decline due to geopolitical tensions, demonstrating that Apple&#39;s movement aligns with wider market trends rather than being solely driven by company-specific events.

Apple’s recent legal challenge from VoIP-Pal.com Inc. could impact its operational focus and financial metrics. While the lawsuit&#39;s direct effects are yet to be fully realized, it might introduce legal costs and potential changes in business practices that could affect revenue and earnings forecasts. Specifically, if Apple were to face adverse rulings, it may have to adjust its business practices or pricing, potentially impacting service revenue streams. The market&#39;s reaction, with only a modest share price movement, suggests that the impact might not be deemed significant unless more developments arise.

Over a longer five-year period, Apple has delivered a total return of 134.39%, significantly rewarding its shareholders. This context highlights a strong performance, even if, in the last year, the stock underperformed the US market, which returned 11.7%. This discrepancy raises questions about recent pressures on the stock compared to broader market dynamics.

The current share price movement should also be evaluated in light of analyst price targets, which are approximately 14.5% higher than the present value. This discount signals that analysts might expect Apple to navigate current challenges and achieve its growth targets. Such a target anticipates that planned U.S. facility expansions and new product launches, such as the iPhone 16e, will drive revenue and earnings growth. However, the broader macroeconomic conditions and legal outcomes are potential uncertainties.

“iPhone and iPad sell-through in China are positively surprising this quarter thanks to 618 Festival promotion momentum,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, adding that the trend suggests “up to $4B June revenue upside vs. MSe, all else equal.”

“Specifically, we now see ~3.0M units of upside to our June quarter iPhone shipments and ~2.5M units of upside to our June quarter iPad shipments,” the bank stated.

China’s 618 Festival promotions and national subsidies are said to have been key drivers, leading to “very strong” iPhone sell-through for three consecutive weeks.

The bank’s Greater China Tech Hardware team now estimates 46.5 million iPhone builds and 14.5 million iPad builds in the June quarter, representing year-over-year growth of 19% and 38%, respectively.

That’s up from prior estimates of 45 million iPhones and 13 million iPads.

Using historical seasonal relationships between builds and shipments, Morgan Stanley projects iPhone shipments to hit 49 million, which is “7% above MSe of 46.0M units, and 8% above Consensus at 45.2M.”

For iPads, they now see 14.7 million shipments, “20% above MSe of 12.3M units, and 12% above Consensus.”

While near-term Services growth uncertainty remains a concern for investors, Morgan Stanley stated: “Estimate upside is typically accompanied by multiple expansion, so watch for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to potentially catch a short-term bid given the stock is trading towards the lower-end of its 24-32x P/E range over the last 2 years.”

Investor reaction was tepid, with shares dipping modestly last week as expectations around Apple Intelligence went unmet.

Unlike peers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (GOOG), Apple has not signalled large-scale AI infrastructure investments. The recent iPhone upgrade cycle appears subdued: iPhone revenue was about $46.8 billion in the latest quarter, roughly 2% higher year on year, suggesting limited upside from incremental AI features.

Apple&#39;s Services segment faces fresh headwinds after losing an appeal in the Epic Games App Store case, which may pressure commission revenues. Wearables also saw softer growth despite Vision Pro contributions, highlighting potential challenges in key growth areas.

Valuation remains rich: Apple trades at about 27.6 times expected earnings for the current fiscal year and around 25.3 times for next year, while peers carry lower multiples with stronger EPS momentum. Buybacks may have less impact at these levels.

Investors are likely to monitor whether Apple ramps AI spending to catch up or relies on its ecosystem to monetize future services. With other big tech doubling down on AI, Apple&#39;s ability to pivot may be critical for sustaining growth and justifying its premium valuation.

While devices are essential for expanding Roku-powered households, the segment continues to face financial strain, with persistent losses and margin pressure. Roku maintains that its priority is growing its streaming footprint, even at the cost of short-term Devices profits.

These trends are expected to continue. For the second quarter of 2025, Roku projects Devices revenues to decline around 10% year over year, with margins staying negative. To manage macro and tariff-related risks, the company is leaning on its diversified manufacturing and flexible pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roku’s second quarter 2025 revenues of the Devices segment is pegged at $124.42 million and the estimate for the gross loss of the segment is pegged at $14.06 million.

To improve brand appeal and deepen engagement, Roku recently launched a refreshed device lineup. The updated Roku-made TVs feature better picture and sound quality, faster app launches and deeper bass. The new Pro Series introduces QLED and Mini-LED technology, along with an upgraded Voice Remote Pro and software features like Smart Picture and personalized Backdrops.

Despite similar efforts in the past, profitability remains elusive. In the first quarter of 2025, Devices revenues rose 11% year over year to $140 million (13.7% of total revenues), but the segment posted a gross loss of $19 million and a negative 14% margin due to lingering holiday promotions. While unit sales were strong, the Devices business continues to function as a long-term strategic lever rather than a near-term profit engine.

Several players are competing with Roku’s devices business, with companies like Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL offering alternative streaming hardware and expanding their user ecosystems.

Amazon continues to expand its Fire TV lineup, combining affordability with Alexa integration to drive adoption. Amazon’s Fire TV devices remain a key part of its strategy to increase engagement within its content and services ecosystem.

Apple’s premium Apple TV 4K appeals to users seeking a high-performance experience with seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. Apple continues to attract loyal users through tight ecosystem linkages and exclusive content.

ROKU shares have gained 10.3% in the trailing three months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s return of 22% but underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10.6%.</p>

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?

As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space

President Donald Trump’s tariff regime may not be having the desired effect of bringing manufacturing back to the US yet, but it’s making companies sound a lot more patriotic.

At least that’s what executives are projecting during earnings calls.

During first-quarter conferences, they touted their “Made in America” credentials or domestic production capabilities at a record rate, with firms in the S&amp;P 500 Index calling out their domestic production over 200 times, compared with a 25-year average of around 50 mentions per earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.

Talk is cheap, though, much cheaper than actually investing in the US. Despite the patriotic enthusiasm, there’s little evidence corporate America has broken ground on new domestic facilities.

“There have been anecdotal announcements from drug companies, or otherwise, talking about investments here in the US,” Brent Thielman, who covers the construction and engineering industries for DA Davidson &amp; Co., said in an interview. “But when that comes to fruition remains to be seen.”

Altogether, companies ranging from Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars of spending in the US since Trump’s election. Many of those commitments weren’t new or were in line with previous spending patterns.

Touting new projects in response to tariffs could appear reactive, while highlighting projects already underway is a savvy way to calm investors in uncertain times, said Emily Borders, chief client officer at Highwire, a public relations agency.

“It’s very difficult to set up a ‘Made in the USA’ program overnight. In fact, you can’t do that,” Borders said. “However, many organizations have been doing really interesting things in that regard or have had initiatives in that regard for a while and those may not have been top of mind with some of their constituencies.”

Like some of those investment announcements, touting your domestic production bona fides could have the added benefit of keeping the heat from the White House at bay, though that’s not a certainty.</p>

May alone saw about $1 billion of India-made iPhones land stateside, the second-largest monthly tally after March&#39;s $1.3 billion, according to customs data. In the first five months of 2025, Foxconn has sent $4.4 billion worth of devices from India to Americaalready surpassing the full-year 2024 total of $3.7 billion.

Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors that most iPhones sold in the June quarter in the U.S. would be built in India, part of a broader push to diversify manufacturing beyond China. Foxconn&#39;s plants and Tata Electronics&#39; three South India facilitieswhere 86% of their March-April output also went to the U.S.are central to that strategy. Apple has even lobbied Chennai airport officials to cut customs clearance times from 30 hours to six, smoothing the export pipeline.

While India faces its own tariff negotiationsa baseline 10% import duty and a paused 26% surcharge proposed by the Trump administrationApple&#39;s shift underscores how global supply chains are realigning around tariff arbitrage. In parallel, former President Trump has threatened 25% levies on iPhones not made in the U.S. and floated 55% duties on Chinese goods, highlighting the political stakes.

Why It Matters: With India becoming a primary export hub for U.S. iPhone sales, Apple could trim tariff drag and fortify its supply resiliencebut must navigate evolving duties and geopolitical headwinds.

The rebound in Apple&#39;s two biggest marketsChina and the U.S.drove much of the gain, with China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures backing up Counterpoint&#39;s findings: April foreign-brand phone shipments in China rose to 3.52 million units from 3.50 million a year earlier.

Beyond North America and Greater China, Apple saw double-digit growth in Japan, India and Middle Eastern markets, reflecting successful tariff-dodge strategies and robust demand for its latest models.

Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam said Q2 looks promising but warned that swings either way are dictated by the U.S. and China, underscoring Apple&#39;s reliance on those two regions.

Despite soaring sales, Apple still faces stiff competition from Huawei, vivo and other domestic brands that have ramped up marketing and value-priced handsets in China. Revenue impact hinges on whether Apple can sustain momentum against local rivals and manage its premium pricing in the face of broader economic pressures.

The May surge follows Apple&#39;s strategic push to diversify its supply chainshifting more assembly to India and Vietnam to mitigate tariff risksand aggressive promotions in mature and emerging markets.

With the iPhone 15 lineup mid-cycle and iOS 18 beta testing underway, Apple is betting that software upgrades and services bundling can reinforce hardware appeal.

Why It Matters: Dominating Chinaa market that accounts for roughly 20% of Apple&#39;s revenuesignals healthy demand for high-end smartphones and could bolster Apple&#39;s overall growth outlook amid macro headwinds.

The iPhone maker recorded its best two-month performance in the country since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global iPhone sales climbed 15% year over year across April and May, supported by strength in China and the U.S., with additional growth in Japan, India, and the Middle East.

Aggressive price cuts helped lift Apple&#39;s sales in China. The company reduced prices on its iPhone 16 lineup by up to 2,530 yuan (about $351), in a bid to compete with local players such as Huawei. Analysts note the discounts helped restore momentum but may not be a sustainable strategy over the longer term.

Data from China&#39;s telecom regulator also showed a slight rise in foreign-brand smartphone shipments in April, signaling steady consumer interest despite rising competition.

Counterpoint&#39;s Ivan Lam said iPhone shipments for the second quarter appear promising, although future performance may hinge on sustained demand in Apple&#39;s two largest markets.

Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Apple Inc is $231.02 with a high estimate of $300.00 and a low estimate of $141.00. The average target implies a upside of +15.97% from the current price of $199.20.

Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Apple Inc in one year is $209.54, suggesting a upside of +5.19% from the current price of $199.20.

10 stocks we like better than Apple ›

There&#39;s probably not a money manager on Wall Street who garners as much attention as Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. The appropriately named &#34;Oracle of Omaha&#34; has overseen a nearly 6,000,000% aggregate return in his company&#39;s Class A shares (BRK.A) through the closing bell on June 9. For the sake of comparison, the broad-based S&amp;P 500&#39;s total return, including dividends, is a shade over 40,000% over the same 60-year timeline.

Despite Buffett being 94 years old and planning to step down as CEO by the end of the year, investors still eagerly follow his investing activity. Riding Buffett&#39;s coattails and mirroring his trading activity has been a profitable venture for decades.

But one of the most defining aspects of Warren Buffett&#39;s investment philosophy has been his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both Buffett and late right-hand man Charlie Munger believed in putting an outsized percentage of their company&#39;s invested assets to work in their best ideas.

With less than seven months to go before Buffett officially cedes his long-held executive role to Greg Abel, he&#39;s wagering 72% ($203.3 billion) of Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s $283 billion of invested assets on just seven unstoppable stocks.

Despite Buffett paring down 67% of Berkshire&#39;s stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since Sept. 30, 2023, it still represents the Oracle of Omaha&#39;s largest holding by a substantial amount.

While Apple&#39;s calling card has often been its innovation, as well as its ongoing transformation into a higher-margin subscription-driven operating model, Buffett&#39;s investment in Apple primarily revolves around his keen understanding of consumer behaviors. Apple has an exceptionally loyal customer base, and most importantly consumers trust the brand.

Additionally, Apple has the world&#39;s leading share-repurchase program. Since kicking off its buyback initiative in 2013, Apple has spent more than $750 billion to reduce its outstanding share count by 43.3%. Lowering its share count has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the company&#39;s earnings per share.</p>

The increase in global sales was primarily driven by a return to growth in Apple&#39;s two largest markets, China and the United States, preliminary data from Counterpoint Research showed.

The company was aided in part by tariff dodgers and also saw double-digit increases in Japan, India and the Middle Eastern markets, Counterpoint said.

&#34;Q2 iPhone performance looks promising at the moment, but as always, swings either way are dictated by two markets - the U.S. and China,&#34; Ivan Lam, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint Research said.

Calculations based on data from the government-affiliated China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed that April shipments of foreign-branded phones in China rose to 3.52 million units from 3.50 million a year earlier.

Apple has faced increased competition from domestic rivals in China and has resorted to price cuts to stay competitive.

Chinese e-commerce platforms were offering discounts of up to 2,530 yuan ($351) on Apple&#39;s latest iPhone 16 models in May.

Picking the right S&amp;P 500 stocks requires more than just buying big names, and that’s where StockStory comes in. Keeping that in mind, here are two S&amp;P 500 stocks that could deliver good returns and one that may struggle.

Market Cap: $14.05 billion

Listed on the NYSE in 1947, Textron (NYSE:TXT) provides products and services in the aerospace, defense, industrial, and finance sectors.

Why Does TXT Worry Us?

Organic revenue growth fell short of our benchmarks over the past two years and implies it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy

Demand will likely be soft over the next 12 months as Wall Street’s estimates imply tepid growth of 6.7%

Capital intensity has ramped up over the last five years as its free cash flow margin decreased by 5.2 percentage points

At $78.50 per share, Textron trades at 12.4x forward P/E. If you’re considering TXT for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.

Market Cap: $2.98 trillion

Creator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.

Why Could AAPL Be a Winner?

Apple&#39;s revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently.

Still, Apple&#39;s devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk.

The company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn’t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.

Apple’s stock price of $198.57 implies a valuation ratio of 26.6x forward price-to-earnings. Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our full research report, it’s free.

Market Cap: $3.54 trillion

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.</p>

On June 10, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated an “Outperform” rating and $250.00 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Highlighting the recent keynote, analysts stated how it matched expectations of a transition year and that there were minimal announcements. One of the main announcements was Apple’s decision to allow developers access to its foundational AI models, which power Apple Intelligence. This permission will integrate AI features into apps that can operate independently of internet connectivity.

To conclude, all the announcements were largely in line with analyst predictions before the event. This is why the keynote likely did not revise perceptions of Apple’s stock value.

Here are his comments:

Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, particularly the iPhones and MacBooks.

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you&#39;re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta&#39;s $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup&#39;s CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.

The deal, announced on Thursday, was Meta&#39;s second-largest investment to date. It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition.

The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors&#39; access to Scale&#39;s services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals&#39; operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet&#39;s Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta&#39;s stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back.

In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.

Alexandr Wang, Scale&#39;s 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale&#39;s board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed.

Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University.

Trump&#39;s antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added.

&#34;That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,&#34; Kovacic said.

Federal Trade Commission probes into past &#34;aquihire&#34; deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon&#39;s deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft&#39;s $650 million deal with Inflection AI. The latter allowed Microsoft to use Inflection&#39;s models and hire most of the startup&#39;s staff, including its co-founders.</p>

AMD shares have lost 3.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 2.5% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 16.4%.

The underperformance can be attributed to increasing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty, which are attributed to higher tariffs.  Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.

However, AMD is benefiting from its expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base.

AMD is strengthening its footprint in the artificial intelligence (AI) market through an expanding portfolio. AMD recently introduced its comprehensive, end-to-end AI platform at the 2025 Advancing AI event, introducing the powerful Instinct MI350 Series GPUs with 4x generational AI compute gains. 

The company also showcased its open, rack-scale AI infrastructure and ROCm 7 software stack, enabling scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment. Strategic partners like Meta Platforms META, OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, and Oracle ORCL highlighted AMD’s growing role in powering next-gen AI workloads.

Meta Platforms announced the broad deployment of AMD Instinct MI300X for Llama 3 and Llama 4 inference. Meta Platforms also expressed strong interest in the MI350 Series and is collaborating with AMD on future AI roadmaps, including the MI400 platform.

Microsoft also announced that AMD Instinct MI300X is powering both proprietary and open-source models in production on Microsoft Azure. The collaboration with Microsoft supports scalable AI workloads across the cloud.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is among the first to adopt AMD’s open rack-scale AI infrastructure featuring the MI355X GPUs. Oracle is also building zettascale AI clusters using up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs to support large-scale AI workloads.

AMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. The company’s strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.

EPYC processors are now deployed by all top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor companies. These processors are also gaining momentum in automotive, manufacturing, and energy sectors.</p>

CRWV has guided 2025 revenues to be in the range of $4.9-$5.1 billion, fueled by surging AI-infrastructure demand. CRWV is an AI-focused hyperscaler company and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support and accelerate GenAI. Businesses have been increasing spending on AI inference/fine-tuning, AI workload monitoring and training infrastructure, including training compute, AI servers, AI storage, cloud workloads and networking. This increasing demand for AI-cloud platforms, including integrated software and infrastructure, bodes well for CRWV.

Strategic deal wins like the OpenAI contract (which has a value up to $11.9 billion) and a $4 billion expansion with a major AI-enterprise client are driving forward revenue visibility. The company also unveiled the next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.

CoreWeave now boasts a growing network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.

With a success-based capex model and expanding global reach, CoreWeave appears well-positioned to capture a significant share of the AI-infrastructure market. On the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028.

This uptrend in spending will benefit other players in this space, including smaller players like Nebius Group N.V. NBIS and tech behemoths like Microsoft Corporation MSFT.

Driven by accelerating demand for its AI-infrastructure services, Nebius remains confident in achieving the full-year annualized run-rate revenue (“ARR”) guidance of $750 million to $1 billion. For 2025, the company also reaffirmed its overall revenue guidance of $500 million to $700 million. In the first quarter of 2025, ARR saw a 700% jump, highlighting a structurally expanding revenue base. ARR for April was $310, which provides a strong start for the second quarter. To gain a larger share of the AI-cloud compute market, NBIS is focusing on technical enhancements that increase reliability and reduce downtime to boost customer retention.</p>

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">SoundHound AI’s SOUN rollout of Amelia 7.0, unveiled on May 8, marks a significant milestone, shifting its voice AI suite from reactive assistants to fully agentic, voice-enabled AI agents that understand, reason and act autonomously. Built on the proprietary Agentic+ framework, these agents offer a hybrid of deterministic flows and generative AI. This enables them to complete multi-step tasks, like reordering prescriptions or resetting passwords, without human intervention.

Technically, Amelia 7.0 integrates Polaris ASR, delivering low latency and 99% intent recognition accuracy, alongside seamless LLM interoperability and enterprise-grade guardrails. This positions SoundHound not just as a voice AI player, but as a leader in agentic AI, a rapidly emergent category poised for exponential adoption across industries.

The timing is strategic. During the first quarter of 2025, SoundHound’s revenue jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million, supported by expanded voice commerce in restaurants and automotive integrations. Though slightly below expectations, the company maintained strong guidance ($157–177 million for 2025), backed by a record pipeline and $246 million in cash with no debt.

Amelia 7.0 could be a catalyst, offering defenses against commoditization in speech-to-text markets and unlocking new revenue streams via autonomous agents in healthcare, finance, customer service, and more. Still, SoundHound must convert technological leadership into clear monetization, maintain competitive gross margins, and scale enterprise adoption amid macroeconomic pressures.

Amelia 7.0 is a transformative leap. If SoundHound can translate this tech into scale, the stock could enjoy a strong re-rating. However, execution is key, especially in proving ROI and driving profitable growth across diverse verticals.

As SoundHound pushes forward with Amelia 7.0, it faces mounting competition from both established tech giants and specialized AI players, who are also sculpting the voice AI frontier.

Microsoft Corporation MSFT, through its Azure OpenAI integrations and Nuance Communications unit, remains a formidable force. Nuance’s deep roots in healthcare voice automation and conversational AI give Microsoft a strong enterprise footprint. By embedding large language models into voice-enabled workflows, Microsoft is targeting the same high-value verticals, like finance and call centers, that SoundHound seeks to disrupt.

Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google, with its Assistant and Vertex AI platforms, is another heavyweight rival. Google Assistant is already embedded in millions of devices, and Vertex AI provides developers with customizable voice agents powered by Google&#39;s advanced speech-to-text and LLM models. Its scalability and ecosystem—spanning Android, Smart Home, and Workspace—present a serious challenge to SoundHound’s adoption in consumer and enterprise environments.</p>

The move is part of the company&#39;s effort to streamline cafe operations and boost U.S. sales.

Dubbed Green Dot Assist, the tool will begin testing in 35 stores this month and is expected to expand across the U.S. and Canada in fiscal 2026. Baristas will be able to use a tablet to ask questions via voice or text, receiving real-time support on drink prep and equipment troubleshooting.

CEO Brian Niccol&#39;s turnaround strategy aims to shorten service times to four minutes and refocus the company on its core brand. The new AI assistant is designed to help staff work more efficiently by reducing reliance on manuals or internal systems.

Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre said the assistant could eventually create IT tickets automatically or suggest shift changes, further integrating into store operations.

The Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) partnership comes nearly a year after CEO Satya Nadella stepped down from Starbucks&#39; board. The system includes a grounding engine to prevent AI inaccuracies, or hallucinations.

The company also showcased next-generation Mastrena espresso machines and a simplified point-of-sale system that allows experienced baristas to get up to speed within an hour and helps personalize customer experiences.

Other restaurant chains have tested AI with varied outcomes. Yum Brands has partnered with Nvidia on AI vision tools, while McDonald&#39;s recently ended an AI drive-thru test with IBM due to performance issues.

Now, let&#39;s break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.

In a mid-year update, the bank said volatility marked the first half of 2025, with tech shares swinging sharply and investor frustration mounting over the slow contribution from artificial intelligence.

The firm noted its coverage has broadly returned to end-2024 levels, despite gains in major indexes like the NASDAQ Composite and iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV).

A survey conducted by Wells Fargo pointed to weaker IT spending growth in the first half, up just 2% year-on-year, but highlighted continued resilience in cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and generative AI initiatives, particularly in customer service.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the top vendor, with over half of respondents expecting to increase spend.

AI revenue monetization remains limited across most of software, the note said, but activity in the data space is picking up, with new SaaS data platforms and acquisitions gaining momentum.

Wells Fargo raised its price targets on Microsoft and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).

The bank sees better seasonal demand benefiting smaller-cap software names in the second half, and upgraded Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) to Overweight and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) to Equal Weight, while downgrading Dayforce and GitLab.

It continues to favor companies undergoing business model transitions, including SAP and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).

Wells Fargo upgraded Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) to Overweight and raised its price target to $385, citing the company’s potential to reach $5 billion in annual recurring revenue by fiscal 2027.

The bank expects over 20% billings growth in fiscal 2026 and sees margin expansion continuing alongside revenue growth.

Zscaler’s shares, it said, remain undervalued relative to peers like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).

Currently, the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant offers an annual dividend yield of 0.69%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 83 cents per share ($3.32 a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $865,318 or around 1,807 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $172,872 or around 361 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($3.32 in this case). So, $6,000 / $3.32 = 1,807 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $3.32 = 361 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Price Action: Shares of Microsoft gained 1.3% to close at $478.87 on Thursday.

Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke maintains Microsoft with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $540 to $605.

10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›

The U.S. equity market bounced back impressively from the turbulence caused by April&#39;s tariff shocks. With strong earnings performance and easing geopolitical tensions, investors are again looking out for the next technology winner.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had a phenomenal run in the past few years, riding high on GPU demand. However, there is one stock that is also building a bigger moat.

Meet Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), a global technology giant that has embedded artificial intelligence (AI) into every layer of its ecosystem. Although Nvidia and Microsoft are currently challenging each other to become the world&#39;s most valuable company, the latter&#39;s approach can enable it to surpass Nvidia significantly by next year. Here&#39;s why.

Nvidia primarily focuses on developing the hardware and software infrastructure needed to drive the ongoing AI revolution. In contrast, Microsoft has built a strong presence across both the AI infrastructure and AI application markets.

Microsoft is leveraging AI technologies to increase performance and lower costs across the entire technology stack, including data center design, hardware, system software, and model optimization.

Subsequently, the company managed to monetize its AI technologies through several avenues -- from direct use, such as Copilot virtual assistants across applications like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, to indirect use through third-party applications built using its Azure AI services.

Microsoft is also scaling up its AI infrastructure rapidly and released the Phi family of small language models (38 million downloads) and BitNet b1.58, which runs on CPUs. This reduced the company&#39;s dependency on GPUs, which can help lower costs and broaden AI accessibility.

Microsoft tools and platforms such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Power Platform are increasingly used by developers to build AI applications. This is creating a strong network effect, as the value of these offerings rapidly increases with new insights provided by the existing developer base, attracting even more developers.

Microsoft has also processed over 100 trillion tokens (such as ID tokens, access tokens, or refresh tokens, which are used for user authentication) in the third quarter, a fivefold increase on a year-over-year basis. This massive scale has given the company a strong data advantage in operational and optimization insights, which hardware players cannot replicate.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF ›

Warren Buffett is the CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company, where he oversees a number of wholly owned subsidiaries and a $281 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities. He plans to step down at the end of 2025, capping off a stellar run of success that dates back to 1965.

Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago, you would have been sitting on a whopping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. But he&#39;s a seasoned expert who knows exactly what to look for when he&#39;s buying stocks, so the average retail investor might struggle to replicate his returns.

Therefore, Buffett often recommends buying low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track indexes like the S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is one he&#39;s suggested by name in the past, and it&#39;s one of the most cost-effective options.

The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF tracks the S&amp;P 500 by investing in exactly the same companies, and if history is any guide, it could turn $500 per month into $1 million over the long term. Here&#39;s how.

The S&amp;P 500 is made up of 500 different companies, and they have to meet strict criteria to be included. Each company must have a market capitalization of at least $20.5 billion, and the sum of their earnings (profits) must be positive over the most recent four quarters. But even after ticking every box, a special committee has the final say over which companies make the cut.

The 500 companies in the S&amp;P 500 come from 11 different sectors of the economy. Some sectors have a higher representation than others because the index is weighted by market capitalization, which means the largest companies have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest.

That&#39;s why the information technology sector has a massive weighting of 30.4%. It&#39;s home to the world&#39;s three largest companies -- Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, which have a combined market cap of $10 trillion.

The table below breaks down the top five sectors in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, their weightings, and some of the popular stocks within them:</p>

The new ETF uses proprietary research to evaluate the top AI companies to invest in.

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives oversees the ETF that bears his name.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great way to gain exposure to the hot field of artificial intelligence (AI). ETFs provide a diversified portfolio of AI stocks while typically charging low fees.

A new AI ETF emerged recently, and what makes this one stand out is that it&#39;s overseen by Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wall Street firm Wedbush Fund Advisors. Naturally, the fund, the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (NYSEMKT: IVES), is named after its founder.

But just because it sports the name of a well-known stock market analyst doesn&#39;t mean the ETF is a buy. Here&#39;s a deeper look into this new opportunity to invest in the hot field of artificial intelligence.

Ives started his namesake ETF because he&#39;s excited about the transformative power artificial intelligence brings to every industry. He told Fox Business, &#34;In 25 years covering tech, I&#39;ve never seen a bigger theme than the AI revolution.&#34;

The fund is made up of 30 businesses across a number of industries ranging from semiconductor manufacturing and robotics to cybersecurity and consumer products. What ties these disparate companies together is that each has developed strong AI capabilities in their fields.

The Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF encompasses many key players in the AI space, including tech stalwarts Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, Palo Alto Networks, and of course, AI darling Nvidia. Some newcomers to the AI arena are also included, such as SoundHound AI and C3.ai.

All 30 stocks were handpicked using Ives&#39; proprietary investment framework. Ives intends to actively manage the roster of companies in his ETF, and the plan is to reconfigure and rebalance the stocks quarterly. At the time of this writing, Microsoft has the heaviest weighting in the ETF at 5.65%.

Ives described this process to CNBC, saying:

While available to all investors, the ETF is aimed at retail investors. Ives explained there&#39;s &#34;a heavy focus on retail for all the investors that follow me.&#34;</p>

10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›

Quantum computing stocks are still quite hot in the market, although their week-to-week performance can be incredibly volatile. For example, one of the more popular quantum computing plays, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI), set a new all-time high right at the end of 2024, but plunged 70% just a few weeks into 2025. Now, it&#39;s only off around 40% from its all-time high. One of its peers, IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), has also seen extreme volatility, although not quite the same level as Rigetti.

Of these two, is one a more attractive stock to buy? Although quantum computing is still a few years away from being widely used commercially, any quantum company could have a breakthrough at a moment&#39;s notice, and send shares soaring. That alone is enough to get some investors excited about the stocks, but I think there&#39;s one pick that might prevail in this analysis.

Both IonQ and Rigetti are quantum computing start-ups that rely on external funding to continue their operations. Both companies have issued more shares, taken on debt, and received contracts for their work. Basically, any funding source that&#39;s outside of actual profitability. Until these companies can prove quantum computing&#39;s relevance to everyday problems, they will be in this external funding state, which makes examining cash piles and resource burn critical.

Free cash flow (FCF) is an excellent measure of understanding how much cash is burning each quarter, as it utilizes operating cash flow and subtracts capital expenditures from that figure as well. For unprofitable companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, this allows investors to understand how long their current cash pile would last if operations continued in their present state.

IonQ has around 16 quarters of cash left, and Rigetti has about 13 quarters left. However, Rigetti Computing is also undergoing a capital raise, as it is issuing enough stock to generate $350 million in additional funds for the company. This will ensure the company&#39;s finances and allow it to invest more aggressively in its quantum computing capabilities.

Both companies believe that 2030 will be a turning point for quantum computing. IonQ believes it will be profitable by then, and Rigetti points out that the quantum computing market will dramatically expand in the decade following 2030.</p>

Today&#39;s Featured Research Reports

Shares of Microsoft have gained +8.5% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry&#39;s gain of +12.5%. The company capitalizes on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion. Strong Office 365 Commercial demand has been notably propelling Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth.

ARPU increases through E5 and M365 Copilot uptake across key segments. Intelligent Cloud revenues advance through Azure AI development and AI Copilot business growth. Strategic execution has been enhancing non-AI services through enterprise customer growth and operational scale improvements. Xbox content and services benefit from robust performance across third-party and first-party content offerings.

The Zacks analyst expects that fiscal 2025 net sales will increase 13.7% compared to fiscal 2024. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain concerns for shareholders.

AstraZeneca&#39;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (+13.9% vs. -5.0%). The company has a diverse product portfolio and a global footprint. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Fasenra should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong, with pivotal late and mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up.

AstraZeneca has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth. Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period.

However, potentially lower sales of Lynparza and Farxiga in China, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology and slowing sales of rare disease drugs are expected to hurt the top line in 2025. Ongoing China investigations are also matters of concern.

Shares of BlackRock have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +18.7%). The company&#39;s inorganic expansion strategy, aimed at boosting its presence in lucrative alternatives and private equity assets, alongside product diversification efforts, will likely aid top-line and assets under management (AUM) growth.

The Zacks analyst expects total revenues and AUM to witness a CAGR of 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, over the next three years. A solid liquidity position and earnings strength will likely keep capital distribution activities sustainable.

However, elevated expenses (primarily due to higher general and administration costs and acquisitions) are a headwind. We project expenses to jump 10.9% in 2025. The company&#39;s significant dependence on overseas revenues exposes it to geopolitical tensions, diverse regulatory and economic environments, and exchange rate fluctuations.

Taylor Devices&#39; shares have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the past year (-17.1% vs. +5.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $110.55 million have seen total revenue fell 5% amid a 13% decline in U.S. sales, driving net income down 12%. Rising inventory and slower turnover point to execution inefficiencies, while SG&amp;A burdens increased due to elevated stock-based compensation. Receivables rose 29% and billing efficiency weakened.

Nevertheless, Taylor Devices demonstrates strong financial resilience with a debt-free balance sheet and $35.4 million in liquidity as of February 2025. A growing backlog of $33.3 million enhances near-term revenue visibility, with 146 open sales orders, indicating higher project value despite fewer long-term deals.

International sales surged 61% YoY, especially in Asia, where revenues doubled to 10%, signaling successful geographic diversification. The firm derives 63% of its revenues from long-term contracts, supporting cash flow stability. Industrial sales rose 36% YoY, reducing reliance on cyclical U.S. infrastructure spending.

Shares of Geospace Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Measuring Instruments industry over the past year (-29.4% vs. +7.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $85.68 million is witnessing Energy Solutions which faces sharp revenue declines, weak contract visibility and uncertain PRM monetization. Intelligent Industrial softness and rising operating costs strain margins.

With increasing customer concentration and weak cash flows, execution risk remains high. Trading at deep discounts to peers, the stock offers value contingent on Smart Water scale-up and margin recovery. Nevertheless, Geospace is leveraging its Smart Water segment as a key growth driver, with revenue up 47.7% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2025, now 30.3% of year-to-date sales.

Growth is fueled by Hydroconn connector demand, Aquana momentum and the June 2025 launch of AquaLink, which expands its SaaS-like IoT footprint into multi-family markets. A strong, debt-free balance sheet with $19.8 million in cash and $15 million in credit supports strategic R&amp;D and M&amp;A optionality.

10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hit a new all-time high early on Wednesday -- making it the only company at the moment valued at a market cap over $3.5 trillion.

Investors wondering which &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; stock could be next to have come to the right place. Here&#39;s the case for why Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could follow in Microsoft&#39;s footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now.

The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft and hit all-time highs is because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs.

Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it&#39;s a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come.

Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries.

Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins.

Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company&#39;s Family of Apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok.

It wasn&#39;t long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company&#39;s compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company&#39;s main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations.</p>

10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›

After only a couple of months on the stock market, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) already has made its mark. This is thanks to the company&#39;s close ties with artificial intelligence (AI) superpower Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its own soaring levels of revenue in recent times. Investors looking for the next big AI growth story clearly have their eyes on CoreWeave.

The company&#39;s initial public offering (IPO) fell flat in its first days, but it&#39;s important to keep in mind the timing of this event. It happened in late March as investors were preoccupied by Preside Trump&#39;s tariffs on imports and their potential impact on the economy -- this weighed on indexes, and particularly on growth stocks. So, this may have hurt early demand for CoreWeave shares.

Since, though, the situation has quickly turned around. As the U.S. initiated trade talks with China -- a key country concerned by tariffs -- general market sentiment improved, and this has boosted AI stocks. Meanwhile, CoreWeave also has wowed investors with its triple-digit revenue growth. Is CoreWeave a buy today? Let&#39;s find out.

So, first let&#39;s consider CoreWeave&#39;s business and the company&#39;s relationship with Nvidia. CoreWeave&#39;s operations actually revolve around the technology of the AI superstar as it offers customers access to its huge fleet of Nvidia AI chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs). This AI company on the rise has 250,000 GPUs across more than 30 data centers, and customers can rent access to them -- even on an hourly basis. Don&#39;t let this hourly element fool you though -- CoreWeave&#39;s contract terms generally span two to five years, offering visibility on revenue to come.

Nvidia is a clear believer in the company as it holds a 7% stake, and Nvidia has given CoreWeave priority when it comes to rolling out its latest GPUs. For example, earlier this year, CoreWeave was the first to make Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell compute power generally available. Nvidia launched its Blackwell architecture and chip in the fourth quarter of last year, and demand was high, even surpassing supply -- so CoreWeave&#39;s ability to rapidly bring this GPU to users was a big deal.

CoreWeave hasn&#39;t escaped the attention of some of the world&#39;s biggest tech companies -- names including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and IBM have flocked to CoreWeave for access to GPUs as they ramp up their AI platforms. In fact, for the past two years, Microsoft was CoreWeave&#39;s biggest customer, representing 35% of revenue in 2023 and 62% in 2024.</p>

Started in 1998 as a platform to broadcast press conferences, ON24’s (NYSE:ONTF) software helps organizations organize online webinars and other virtual events and convert prospects into customers.

Projected sales decline of 6% over the next 12 months indicates demand will continue deteriorating

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?

As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space

Shares of Mastercard shed as much as 6.2% Friday, while Visa lost more than 7.1% — the worst one-day drop in about two months for both stocks. Shares of other payment companies such as American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. also slipped in intraday trading.

The sector is being weighed down by a Wall Street Journal report citing unidentified people that Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among companies that have recently discussed issuing their own stablecoins in the US. In addition to large merchants, other multinational giants like airline operators and Expedia Group, Inc. have also considered issuing their own crypto tokens to bypass credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are usually pegged to a currency like the US dollar so the tokens can be used for payments.

Though the news erased more than $60 billion in market value from Visa and Mastercard combined, analysts said now is a good time to snap up the stocks at a discount.

“We encourage investors to accumulate shares of Visa and Mastercard on weakness,” Andrew Jeffrey of William Blair wrote in a note, reiterating outperform ratings on both companies.

Jeffrey said stablecoins are still not very suitable for business-to-consumer commerce, “even as merchants view them as a potential means of lowering card acceptance costs.”

Consumers are accustomed to using credit and debit cards, habits that won’t soon change, he said, adding that a lack of stablecoin standards can also limit its use. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Diksha Gera said that Friday’s share declines reflect fears that stablecoins could erode volume share and margin, but it’s a premature worry.

“Visa and Mastercard have proactively integrated stablecoin capabilities, while lingering trust and regulatory hurdles, along with a prolonged adoption curve by consumers, might impede widespread adoption,” Gera wrote in a note.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Rufus Hone agrees that broad-based stablecoin adoption within consumer payments is an unlikely outcome, but said even if the tokens are adopted, Visa and Mastercard are poised to benefit.</p>

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">Amazon tapped into an emerging trend this week, one that’s seeing big tech firms buy power from existing nuclear power plants.

The tech company will power a chunk of its AWS cloud and AI servers using 1.92 gigawatts of electricity from Talen Energy’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Amazon is the latest hyperscaler to go direct to big nuclear operators, following on the heels of Microsoft and Meta.

Amazon’s deal was announced Wednesday, but it’s not entirely new, instead modifying an existing arrangement with Talen. The old version had Amazon building a data center next to the Susquehanna power plant, siphoning electricity directly from the facility without first sending it to the grid.

That deal was killed by regulators over concerns that customers would unfairly shoulder the burden of running the grid. Today, Susquehanna provides power to the grid, meaning every kilowatt-hour includes transmission fees that support the grid’s maintenance and development. Amazon’s behind-the-meter arrangement would have sidestepped those fees.

This week’s revisions shift Amazon’s power purchase agreement in front of the meter, meaning the AWS data center will be billed like other similar customers who are grid-connected. The transmission lines will be reconfigured in spring of 2026, Talen said, and the deal covers energy purchased through 2042.

But wait, there’s more: The two companies also said they will look to build small modular reactors “within Talen’s Pennsylvania footprint” and expand generation at existing nuclear power plants.

Expanding existing power plants is typically an easier way to add new nuclear. They might include switching to more highly enriched fuel to produce more heat, tweaking the settings to squeeze out more power, or renovating the turbines for a bigger bump.

Microsoft kicked off the trend last year when it announced that it would work with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island, a $1.6 billion project that will generate 835 megawatts. Meta hopped aboard earlier this month, also with Constellation, to buy the “clean energy attributes” of a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in Illinois.

Amazon and Talen’s pledge to build new small modular reactors is a longer shot, though there, too, Amazon is in good company with its peers. Several startups are pursuing the concept with the hopes of cutting construction costs by mass-producing parts. Amazon has invested in an SMR startup, X-energy, which is planning to add 300 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia.

New generation at existing reactors and new SMRs are intended “to add net-new energy to the PJM grid,” Talen said, referring to the region’s grid operator. That last bit is likely a bid to head off any criticism from regulators about leaving ratepayers holding the bag.</p>

(Reuters) -Amazon said on Friday its healthcare business will be divided into six new units as part of a restructuring effort, in a move that comes after recent top health executive departures.

The company&#39;s chief medical officer, Sunita Mishra, stepped down last month, while Aaron Martin, who has been the vice president of the healthcare unit, is also set to step down.

This reorganization follows a series of other executive departures, including Vin Gupta, who served as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, and Trent Green, the CEO of One Medical.

Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, said in an email to Reuters that these updates &#34;reflect a broader strategy to better deliver for patients and accelerate innovation across the business.&#34;

&#34;If we can make one thing a little bit easier for a lot of people, we&#39;ll save them a lot of time, a lot of money, and some lives,&#34; Lindsay added.

Amazon has been expanding into the healthcare industry for years, starting with the acquisition of PillPack for $750 million in 2018 and the launch of Amazon Pharmacy in 2020.

It bought One Medical for about $3.9 billion in 2023 to gain access to primary care clinics and a membership model.

In February 2024, Amazon eliminated 115 jobs across its healthcare units, Lindsay had said in a letter to employees. A person cited by Business Insider, which first reported the job cuts, estimated up to 400 employees could lose their jobs.

CNBC first reported the restructuring efforts earlier on Friday.

The e-commerce giant has been working on an overhaul for the past several months, the CNBC report said, adding that Amazon has not conducted any broad layoffs as part of this reorganization.

While devices are essential for expanding Roku-powered households, the segment continues to face financial strain, with persistent losses and margin pressure. Roku maintains that its priority is growing its streaming footprint, even at the cost of short-term Devices profits.

These trends are expected to continue. For the second quarter of 2025, Roku projects Devices revenues to decline around 10% year over year, with margins staying negative. To manage macro and tariff-related risks, the company is leaning on its diversified manufacturing and flexible pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roku’s second quarter 2025 revenues of the Devices segment is pegged at $124.42 million and the estimate for the gross loss of the segment is pegged at $14.06 million.

To improve brand appeal and deepen engagement, Roku recently launched a refreshed device lineup. The updated Roku-made TVs feature better picture and sound quality, faster app launches and deeper bass. The new Pro Series introduces QLED and Mini-LED technology, along with an upgraded Voice Remote Pro and software features like Smart Picture and personalized Backdrops.

Despite similar efforts in the past, profitability remains elusive. In the first quarter of 2025, Devices revenues rose 11% year over year to $140 million (13.7% of total revenues), but the segment posted a gross loss of $19 million and a negative 14% margin due to lingering holiday promotions. While unit sales were strong, the Devices business continues to function as a long-term strategic lever rather than a near-term profit engine.

Several players are competing with Roku’s devices business, with companies like Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL offering alternative streaming hardware and expanding their user ecosystems.

Amazon continues to expand its Fire TV lineup, combining affordability with Alexa integration to drive adoption. Amazon’s Fire TV devices remain a key part of its strategy to increase engagement within its content and services ecosystem.

Apple’s premium Apple TV 4K appeals to users seeking a high-performance experience with seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. Apple continues to attract loyal users through tight ecosystem linkages and exclusive content.

ROKU shares have gained 10.3% in the trailing three months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s return of 22% but underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10.6%.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade progress continues to evolve as framework agreements on rare-earths and other areas are offering cautious optimism, though a lack of detailed commitments keeps investors wary.

Looking to commodities, gold prices are sharply higher, hovering around the $3,400 mark amid continued global trade uncertainty. Additionally, oil prices are mostly flat following multiple days of gains.

The report said the two companies, along with others such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group and major airlines, have discussed launching stablecoins in the U.S., citing people familiar with the matter.

Such a move could shift billions of dollars in payment volume away from banks and card networks, the Journal said, potentially allowing large merchants to reduce transaction fees and tighten control over payment infrastructure.

Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a fixed value against government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar, and are typically backed by cash or short-term Treasurys.

The retailers’ final decisions would hinge on progress of the Genius Act, a bill that aims to establish regulatory oversight for stablecoins.

The legislation recently advanced past a procedural vote but still requires passage by both chambers of Congress.

U.S. retail giants Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) are reportedly exploring issuing their own stablecoins, The Wall Street Journal reported on 13 June.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that, unlike traditionally volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, aims to maintain a stable value. It is generally pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar or a commodity such as gold.

As per the report, Amazon and Walmart are mulling the introduction of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar. Streamlined global payments, lower processing fees, and less dependence on traditional fund transfer infrastructure are among the most prominent factors behind the pivot.

Travel tech firm Expedia Group Inc. and some U.S. airlines are also among the companies that are considering the integration of stablecoin payments into their systems, the report mentions.

However, Amazon and Walmart might also be closely observing the progress of the GENIUS Act that deals with stablecoin regulation, as the bill has been criticized by the Democrats.

Stablecoins are emerging as a viable payments solution for traditional retail institutions of late due to a faster and more economic model.

As reported earlier, companies owned by Wall Street giants such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are also considering launching a joint stablecoin.

As per DeFiLlama, the total stablecoin market cap is worth $251 billion, with Tether&#39;s USDT and Circle&#39;s (NYSE: CRCL) USDC themselves accounting for more than 86% of market share.

Fintech giant PayPal&#39;s PYUSD lags far behind, with a mere 0.0036% share. On the other hand, USD1 — the stablecoin launched by a crypto project linked to President Donald Trump — is slightly ahead of it with a 0.0086% share.

The market for satellite internet is projected to grow rapidly, with analysts estimating it could reach $24.6 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 30%. ASTS stock is following this trend, recording a surging 14% gain over the past week and a 47% gain year-to-date.

What sets ASTS apart is its goal to connect standard, unmodified smartphones directly to satellites—unlike competitors such as SpaceX’s Starlink, which requires proprietary equipment, or Amazon’s (AMZN) Project Kuiper, which focuses on fixed installations. If successful, ASTS could dramatically improve connectivity for billions of people, especially in regions where only about 34% of the Earth currently has cellular coverage.

The company has made notable progress toward key technical and operational milestones and holds sufficient capital to support its near-term plans. While ASTS remains a speculative investment at this stage, I believe its long-term potential is significant and view the upside as compelling.

AST SpaceMobile’s direct-to-smartphone approach requires no special hardware or apps, which could be a game-changing development. This technology could unlock massive markets, particularly in developing countries where traditional internet infrastructure is limited.

The company plans to conduct five launches, each carrying between 20 and 25 satellites, over the next six to nine months, starting with its first Block 2 BlueBird satellite in July 2025. If these launches proceed smoothly, ASTS could begin generating meaningful revenue from both government contracts and commercial partnerships in short order.

Manufacturing is another potential key advantage. The company aims to build the capability to produce six satellites per month by late 2025, which would enable rapid network expansion once the technology is proven in orbit.</p>

Walmart and Amazon are among retailers looking into launching their own stablecoins, according to reports.

Accepting stablecoins as payments could get retailers out of paying interchange fees to credit card providers like Visa and Mastercard.

The Senate is currently considering a bill that would establish a framework for private companies to issue stablecoins.



Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) are reportedly exploring corporate stablecoins as a customer payment option. The move toward issuing their own cryptocurrencies could potentially reduce the billions of dollars the retail titans pay in credit transaction fees.  

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency directly pegged to another commodity, often the U.S. dollar. This is meant to prevent the swings associated with crypto assets like Bitcoin.

If a retailer such as Amazon launched its own stablecoin or accepted existing ones at checkout, it could operate a payments system removed from traditional banks and credit card providers. That would potentially save billions of dollars in fees, including interchange fees paid to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon and Walmart have both explored this option, as have Expedia (EXPE) and other companies including airlines, the report said.

However, companies looking to issue stablecoins will need a little help from the government. The Senate is considering a bill known as the Genius Act, which would establish a framework for private companies to issue stablecoins. The proposal passed an initial procedural vote this week but would require a full floor vote in both chambers of Congress.

A Walmart spokesperson declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to an Investopedia request. Shares of the two retailers were little changed in recent trading. Meanwhile, Visa shares dropped 5% and Mastercard stock slid 4%.

UPDATE—June 13, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect Walmart declining to comment as well as more recent share prices.

The plan calls for two new high-volume fabs in Idahoone slated to start DRAM production in 2027four more fabs in New York, and an expanded, modernized facility in Virginia, alongside advanced HBM packaging and research initiatives.

To finance the buildout, Micron has locked in $275 million under the CHIPS and Science Act and is eligible for up to $6.4 billion in direct funding for its Idaho and New York sites.

CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the move underscores our commitment to driving innovation and strengthening the domestic semiconductor industry, while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo added the investment will ensure the U.S. advances its lead across critical industries like AI, automotive, and aerospace and defense.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services chief Matt Garman praised the expansion as a significant milestone for the semiconductor industry. Even as shares dipped 0.21 percent on the news, analysts note that onshoring DRAM production could shorten supply chains, improve margin visibility and reduce geopolitical risk.

Why It Matters: With global memory demand surgingespecially for AI applicationssecuring a domestic production base could give Micron a strategic edge and help the U.S. lessen dependence on overseas fabs.

Additionally, Micron Technology has rebounded from earlier lows and now carries a 12-month price target of $121.82, suggesting a modest 5.26% upside. The projections vary widely, with a high-end forecast of $172 and a low of $60, signaling some uncertainty. After dipping below $70 earlier this year, the stock has climbed steadily and analysts seem cautiously optimistic moving forward.

10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›

There are some excellent artificial intelligence (AI) stocks you can buy right now. However, my favorite -- and largest AI play in my own portfolio -- is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

To be sure, there are a lot of reasons why I like Amazon as a long-term investment. E-commerce still represents less than one-fifth of all U.S. retail, and there&#39;s massive international expansion potential for the business, just to name a few pluses. But the No. 1 reason I love the stock is Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its potential to drive profits higher over the next decade.

AWS makes up less than 20% of Amazon&#39;s revenue, but it&#39;s the fastest-growing, most profitable part of the company. Despite accounting for less than one-fifth of sales, as noted, AWS was responsible for 63% of the company&#39;s operating income in the first quarter.

However, this could be just the beginning. The global cloud computing market is expected to roughly triple in size by 2030, compared with 2024 levels. Assuming AWS simply maintains its current market share, this means that AWS revenue could rise from $107.6 billion in 2024 to about $342 billion in 2030.

If Amazon can maintain its current operating margin for AWS (it&#39;s likely the margin will improve as the business scales), this would result in about $87 billion in additional annual operating income just from AWS. This alone would likely drive excellent stock returns -- and that&#39;s on top of any value added through profit increases from the retail side.

Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:

These corporate digital tokens, pegged to the U.S. dollar or other government-backed currencies, could dramatically reduce merchant fees and speed up payment settlements, disrupting the dominance of traditional financial institutions.

The move is contingent on the passage of the Genius Act, a proposed regulatory framework for stablecoins that recently passed a key procedural step in Congress. If passed, it could pave the way for large companies to adopt or issue stablecoins as an alternative to existing payment rails.

When Amazon purchased Whole Foods Market back in 2017, it was a safe assumption that the specialty grocer’s image would morph to reflect Amazon’s business. And for a time, that was the direction things were going: Whole Foods’ pricing has gotten more competitive, Amazon Prime serves as a loyalty program of sorts, and the grocer now touts more high-tech payment options, including palm-scanning payment. There was even a stint with Just Walk Out frictionless checkout. 

Now, however, the tables are turning — Amazon seemingly wants to be more like Whole Foods. 

Amazon has spent years finding its footing in an attempt to get its own grocery empire off the ground — particularly with its traditional grocery chain Amazon Fresh — but nothing has wowed the industry or shoppers. And while Amazon Fresh hasn’t indicated that it plans to become a specialty grocer, it is at long last leaning into Whole Foods’ leadership to chart a better course. 

Though Amazon established a single grocery entity back in 2022, Whole Foods and Amazon’s supermarket operations still ran fairly separately. This separation was fine for Whole Foods’ growth, but Amazon continued to play whack-a-mole with store openings and closures for Amazon Fresh. 

This week, Amazon unveiled a restructured leadership team for its Worldwide Grocery division that includes top executives from Whole Foods Market. This internal shift comes less than six months after Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel stepped in to helm both Whole Foods and Amazon’s grocery business as vice president for worldwide grocery stores. 

It seems Amazon is finally recognizing that Whole Foods is an asset not just as a specialty banner, but also as a key guide to Amazon’s grocery ambitions. With Amazon Fresh treading water for so long, it’s odd Amazon didn’t call in Whole Foods for an assist years ago.

Thousands of grocery workers across three states threaten to strike

This week, 45,000 unionized grocery workers in Southern California authorized an Unfair Labor Practice strike against Kroger and Albertsons, according to a United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770 announcement. 

Safeway workers in Colorado and employees at Kroger and Albertsons’ banners in Washington state have already voted in favor of authorizing a strike. The strike threats come as three local unions under the UFCW are separately negotiating contracts with the grocers. </p>

The advancements are generative AI mapping technology known as Wellspring, an AI-powered demand forecasting model ,and new agentic AI capabilities for robotics.

Amazon stated: “While these systems work behind the scenes, customers will certainly experience their benefits: more accurate delivery locations, faster shipping options and improved availability of the products they want, when they want them.”

Wellspring will improve delivery accuracy for customers. It maps millions of locations by integrating data from multiple sources such as satellite imagery and customer instructions, aiding drivers in navigating complex areas.

The system has mapped 2.8 million apartment addresses to their corresponding buildings and identified convenient parking locations at four million US addresses.

The AI-powered demand forecasting model predicts customer preferences and streamlines inventory placement. It incorporates variables such as weather and holidays to enhance product availability.

The model has improved long-term national forecasts by 10% and regional forecasts by 20% for popular items, leading to faster deliveries and reduced carbon emissions, resulting in improved customer experience.

The technology is currently being used by Amazon&#39;s operations networks in the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, with plans to extend its reach in the near future.

Amazon Robotics is also developing agentic AI capabilities, enabling robots to understand natural language and perform tasks autonomously.

This technology will transform how robots such as Proteus, an autonomous mobile robot, operate in fulfilment centres, allowing them to assist with heavy lifting and complex tasks. This creates safer work environments and increases operational efficiency.

The company&#39;s attention to practical AI applications demonstrates its focus on solving real-world logistics challenges and improving the overall experience for all stakeholders involved in the delivery process.

In February 2024, Amazon launched its new AI-powered shopping assistant called Rufus to improve experience for its customers.

Amazon has recently committed to the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to improve its systems for detecting and addressing fake reviews.

Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

That’s what Tesla CEO Elon Musk said after revealing the company’s robotaxi test would start on June 22, later than expected, adding that the date could “shift” beyond that. Meanwhile, betting site Polymarket lists only a 30% chance that Tesla (TSLA) launches the service before July, highlighting Musk&#39;s rosy predictions on self-driving that have been constantly pushed back.

While Tesla is on the verge of starting a new chapter for the company, Alphabet’s (GOOG) Waymo has been quietly racking up mile after mile, trip after trip, providing actual paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin — where Tesla’s test will begin.

At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently, but could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.

Waymo has an early lead, and it seems a big one. Rivals like Argo AI and GM-backed Cruise are gone, leaving only smaller players like Zoox (backed by Amazon), China’s Pony AI (PONY), and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla.

Waymo (before it was even called that) started off as an in-house startup as part of Google’s X initiative way back in 2009.

After some testing and securing of permits, the project officially became Waymo in 2016, and it started testing its Pacifica hybrid vans kitted out with cameras, LIDAR laser sensors, and radar.

In 2018 Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker’s I-Pace EV for its testing; these are the vehicles most users are accustomed to seeing.

Waymo&#39;s combination of vision, radar, and LIDAR, which the company calls its “multimodal” approach, has the company claiming it has the best and safest robotaxi solution.

Since 2020, anyone in a service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that the company performs around 250,000 trips a week.

A Waymo spokesperson said that the company has not yet seen a vision-only system that can achieve the levels of safety its current system has achieved, asserting that multiple sensors with overlapping fields of view are the best solution.

Experts tend to agree.

“Waymo is undoubtedly the leader in autonomous driving technology, with their self-driving software (SDS) being widely regarded as best in class,” said University of San Francisco engineering professor William Riggs, an expert in autonomous technology. “They have been around the longest, had patient capital, and have the most miles on the road proving that self-driving tech works.”</p>

The investigation by Mexico&#39;s Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece), which began in 2020, focused on Google&#39;s digital advertising services via its search page as well as third-party websites.

The investigation focused on Google&#39;s advertising services via its search page as well as third-party websites, examining whether the company had an undue advantage over competitors in the digital advertising sector stemming from the design of its platform for buying online advertising.

Cofece said in a statement on Friday that its analysis had determined that Google users were not required to purchase advertising on third-party websites in order to purchase advertising on the Google search engine.

&#34;We appreciate COFECE&#39;s decision recognizing that our products give advertisers the freedom and control to use our tools in the ways that best suit their needs,&#34; a Google spokesperson said.

Google had been facing a fine of up to 8% of its annual revenue in Mexico if Cofece determined it engaged in monopolistic practices.

Google parent Alphabet does not include specific revenue numbers for Mexico in its earnings reports, but according to annual results for 2024, the company&#39;s revenue for its &#34;other Americas&#34; region, which includes Latin America, was about $20.4 billion.

Google is facing antitrust challenges around the world as regulators fear how its search engine gives it an advantage.

In the United States, a U.S. district judge last year ruled Google holds an unlawful monopoly in online search and related advertising.

The U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of states want Google to share search data and cease multibillion-dollar payments to Apple and other smartphone makers to be the default search engine on new devices.

In a separate case, a U.S. federal judge said Google illegally dominated two markets for online advertising technology, with the Justice Department saying that Google should sell off at least its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company&#39;s publisher ad server and its ad exchange.

(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta&#39;s $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup&#39;s CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.

The deal, announced on Thursday, was Meta&#39;s second-largest investment to date. It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition.

The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors&#39; access to Scale&#39;s services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals&#39; operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet&#39;s Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta&#39;s stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back.

In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.

Alexandr Wang, Scale&#39;s 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale&#39;s board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed.

Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University.

Trump&#39;s antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added.

&#34;That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,&#34; Kovacic said.

Federal Trade Commission probes into past &#34;aquihire&#34; deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon&#39;s deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft&#39;s $650 million deal with Inflection AI. The latter allowed Microsoft to use Inflection&#39;s models and hire most of the startup&#39;s staff, including its co-founders.</p>

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Alphabet&#39;s Google, the largest customer of Scale AI, plans to cut ties with Scale after news broke that rival Meta is taking a 49% stake in the AI data-labeling startup, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Google had planned to pay Scale AI about $200 million this year for the human-labeled training data that is crucial for developing technology, including the sophisticated AI models that power Gemini, its ChatGPT competitor, one of the sources said.

The search giant already held conversations with several of Scale AI&#39;s rivals this week as it seeks to shift away much of that workload, sources added.

Scale&#39;s loss of significant business comes as Meta takes a big stake in the company, valuing it at $29 billion. Scale was worth $14 billion before the deal.

Scale AI intends to keep its business running while its CEO, Alexandr Wang, along with a few employees, move over to Meta. Since its core business is concentrated around a few customers, it could suffer greatly if it loses key customers like Google.

In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.

Scale AI raked in $870 million in revenue in 2024, and Google spent some $150 million on Scale AI&#39;s services last year, sources said.

Other major tech companies that are customers of Scale&#39;s, including Microsoft, are also backing away. Elon Musk&#39;s xAI is also looking to exit, one of the sources said. OpenAI decided to pull back from Scale several months ago, according to sources familiar with the matter, though it spends far less money than Google. OpenAI&#39;s CFO said on Friday that the company will continue to work with Scale AI, as one of its many data vendors.

Companies that compete with Meta in developing cutting-edge AI models are concerned that doing business with Scale could expose their research priorities and road map to a rival, five sources said. By contracting with Scale AI, customers often share proprietary data as well as prototype products for which Scale’s workers are providing data-labeling services. With Meta now taking a 49% stake, AI companies are concerned that one of their chief rivals could gain knowledge about their business strategy and technical blueprints.

Google, Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment. xAI did not respond to a request for comment.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced late this week that it plans to streamline the Part 555 exemption process to make it faster for automakers that want to deploy self-driving vehicles built without human controls like a steering wheel or pedals.

The letter sent to “stakeholders” (meaning those companies working on AVs) is fairly opaque still. And manufacturers will still have to demonstrate that vehicles without traditional steering wheels, driver-operated brakes, or rearview mirrors provide an equivalent safety level as compliant vehicles and that the exemption is in the public interest.

The main gist here is that the NHTSA contends the current Part 555 exemption process is not well suited for automated driving system-equipped vehicles and that it is a lengthy and complex process. In short: The agency wants to speed things up.

In other federal agency-related news, Trump issued a few executive orders related to drones and fast-tracking supersonic travel.

Side note: I see that my predictions (from last edition) that the Trump-Elon Musk fallout would turn into one of those on-again, off-again relationships was correct.

Let’s get into the rest of the news. 

Last week, I shared our scoop about Jony Ive’s LoveFrom firm working alongside Rivian designers and a skunkworks team that would end up spinning out into Also, a micromobility startup.

Well, a few more little birds have popped up to share a bit more and to clarify the relationship. I learned that the project was code-named Inder. Rivian actually applied for a trademark of the name Inder but later abandoned it. Sources also shared that while the LoveFrom team brought its industrial design expertise to the effort — and apparently a cool motor design — it was not involved in any UI/UX.

JetZero, the Long Beach, California-based zero-emissions jet aircraft company working on blended wing airplanes, plans to build a factory in Greensboro, North Carolina. The company, which has backing from a variety of venture capital (like Trucks VC) and from strategic investors like United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, said it will invest $4.7 billion over the next decade on the project, The Wall Street Journal reported. Construction on the facility is expected to begin in the first half of 2026, with first customer deliveries in the early 2030s, the company said.</p>

The feature was first introduced to NotebookLM, Google’s AI-based note-taking and research assistant.

The tech giant says Audio Overviews will use its latest Gemini models to give users another way to absorb and understand information.

“An audio overview can help you get a lay of the land, offering a convenient, hands-free way to absorb information whether you’re multitasking or simply prefer an audio experience,” Google explained in a blog post.

The feature is available starting today in Labs, Google’s experimental program. The company says users will see the option to generate a short Audio Overview if Google thinks it would be useful based on their specific query. Once you generate an Audio Overview, you will see a simple audio player with play/pause controls, a volume button, and the option to adjust the playback speed.

Google will display links in the audio player to show where it’s getting the information. If you want to learn more about a topic after listening to an Audio Overview, you can click on the links to dive deeper into your search.

You can give a thumbs up or thumbs down on each Audio Overview, and the experiment as a whole in Labs.

In NotebookLM, Audio Overviews give users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared, such as course readings or legal briefs. Google also brought Audio Overviews to Gemini in March.

Audio Overviews in Search builds on AI Overviews, the AI-generated summaries Google supplies for certain Google Search queries. With Audio Overviews, Google is targeting people who are auditory learners or want more accessible ways to get information.

It’s worth noting that today’s announcement comes a few days after a Wall Street Journal report found that Google’s AI Overviews and other AI-powered tools are killing traffic for news publishers.</p>

The world of self-driving cars is quickly evolving, as a leading automaker prepares for a historic event.

After months of teasing it, Tesla  (TSLA)  is preparing to officially roll out its fleet of autonomous vehicles in Austin, Texas, and its loyal fans are watching closely. CEO Elon Musk has hinged a lot on this self-driving technology, as the company works to usher in a turnaround after months of volatility.

Despite all the recent focus on the Tesla robotaxi debut, Musk’s company isn’t the only automaker that’s been working hard to pull ahead in the driverless race. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, has successfully put self-driving cars on the road in multiple major cities.

Now, a new report has highlighted some of the economics of the self-driving car market, providing key insights into a key area that sparked concern among some financial experts.

As areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced in recent years, the rise of self-driving vehicles has seemed inevitable. Elon Musk, known for his focus on futuristic technology, has helped champion it, even though Tesla is currently still behind Waymo in the driverless race.

Granted, that may change as Tesla’s robotaxi offically enter the market. They won’t be operating fully autonomously, however, as the cars will come with a teleoperator standing by to assist if necessary. As experts have told TheStreet, this means they can’t be considered fully self-driving.

The industry recently received some good news that suggests Waymo is in an excellent position to continue expanding. Market research Obi has published a report on the state of the industry, providing a detailed analysis of its economic elements, with a focus on Waymo, Uber  (UBER) , and Lyft.

The report’s authors highlight Waymo’s undeniable growing presence in San Francisco, a city synonymous with technology and innovation. They also reveal a shocking statistic that bodes extremely well for self-driving technology adoption, but specifically for Waymo: consumers are very willing to pay for a driverless experience.</p>

Google Vice President of Search Elizabeth Reid said In a blog post that the overviews were designed to be a &#34;jumping off point&#34; that provided higher-quality clicks to webpages. &#34;People are more likely to stay on [those pages], because we&#39;ve done a better job of finding the right info and helpful webpages for them.&#34;

However, experts told The Times of London that these answers can be &#34;confidently wrong&#34; and direct searchers away from legitimate information.

When generative AI imagines facts or otherwise makes mistakes, computer scientists refer to it as hallucinating. These hallucinations can include references to non-existent scientific papers, like those NOTUS found were cited in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s &#34;Make America Healthy Again&#34; report, and a host of other errors in judgment.

Shortly after AI Overviews were launched last year, users began to point out the frequency with which these summaries included inaccurate information, the Times of London reports. One of its most notorious hallucinations was the suggestion that a user add non-toxic glue to pizza sauce to help the cheese stick better.

Google pushed back, claiming that many of the examples circulating were fake, but Reid acknowledged in her blog post that &#34;some odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up. And while these were generally for queries that people don&#39;t commonly do, it highlighted some specific areas that we needed to improve.&#34;

According to the experts who spoke to The Times of London, despite the technological advancements and improvements, hallucinations are getting worse rather than better. New reasoning systems are producing more incorrect responses than their predecessors, and designers aren&#39;t sure why.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat, underscoring uncertainty. Market participants remain alert to how the situation might affect tech demand and broader sentiment.

This in-house platform features a more powerful computing system than that used in Rivian&#39;s earlier vehicles and is tailored specifically for its current and future models.

RAP provides Level 2+ autonomy, meaning it supports the driver with alerts and interventions, such as steering corrections and emergency braking, but it never takes full control of the vehicle. The system includes a comprehensive set of ADAS tools, stepping in only when necessary.

Standard on the R1T and R1S models, RAP’s features fall into two main categories: Driving Assist and Active Safety Assist. Driving Assist includes user-activated tools like Highway Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane-Change Assistance. Active Safety Assist includes automatic features aimed at preventing accidents, such as lane safety, lighting adjustments, parking and reversing aids, and collision mitigation. RIVN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

With the introduction of its second-generation R1 platform, Rivian has significantly upgraded RAP. The vehicles now use a revamped perception system and computing setup, including 55-megapixel cameras and onboard processing power exceeding 200 trillion operations per second. The platform’s AI-driven design and vertically integrated hardware allow Rivian to efficiently collect and process high-quality, multi-modal sensor data, giving it a competitive edge in ADAS development. Other automakers like Toyota Motor Corporation TM and Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Tesla TSLA are also making progress on the development of their respective autonomous vehicle platforms.

In April, Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo reached a preliminary agreement to explore a collaboration focused on the development of a new autonomous vehicle platform. Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo aim to combine their respective strengths to develop the platform. In parallel, the companies will explore how to leverage Waymo&#39;s autonomous technology and Toyota&#39;s vehicle expertise to enhance next-generation personally owned vehicles. 

Tesla&#39;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is a sophisticated driver-assistance technology designed to allow Tesla cars to navigate various driving conditions autonomously. FSD builds on Tesla’s existing Autopilot features and is sold as an optional upgrade. The company has long been a leader in autonomous vehicle development. Tesla released its last major FSD update, v13, in December 2024.</p>

This growth underscores growing investor confidence in the company&#39;s quantum annealing technology.

While giants like International Business Machines IBM and Alphabet GOOGL dominate headlines with their gate-based quantum systems, D-Wave has introduced a commercially focused path through quantum annealing, solving complex optimization problems in minutes. This alternative approach of D-Wave is rapidly expanding into commercial use cases in logistics, finance and manufacturing, where it delivers tangible business outcomes today.

D-Wave stands out as a long-term investment by solving real-world problems today, unlike its rivals, which are focused on future gate-model systems. Its annealing-based Advantage2 prototype has already demonstrated quantum advantage, completing tasks in minutes that would take classical supercomputers millennia. With its Leap cloud platform and active deployments at companies like Ford Otosan and NTT DOCOMO, D-Wave is generating real commercial value. As demand for optimization and AI accelerates, its proven technology and enterprise traction give it strong staying power in the quantum space.

IBM: On June 10, 2025, IBM revealed its plan for Quantum Starling, its first fault-tolerant quantum computer, set to be launched by 2029. Designed to run 20,000× more operations than current systems, Starling will use around 200 logical qubits with advanced error correction and real-time oversight. This marks a major step from theory to practical, large-scale quantum computing.

Alphabet: In December 2024, Google unveiled Willow, a 105-qubit processor that marked a major step forward in quantum error correction. Tests showed that adding more qubits significantly reduced error rates, achieving a key milestone known as “below-threshold” scaling. Willow also completed a complex task in under five minutes that would take classical supercomputers trillions of years. Google expects real-world quantum applications within five years in areas like drug discovery, battery design and energy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for D-Wave’s 2025 earnings implies a 72% improvement year over year.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock&#39;s performance in the near future.

Over the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +7.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&#39;s +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock&#39;s future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually make its stock &#39;trending&#39; and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company&#39;s earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors&#39; interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +12.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 points to a change of +18.3%. from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 indicates a change of +8% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock&#39;s near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.</p>

What we&#39;re watching

What we&#39;re reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta&#39;s $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup&#39;s CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.

The deal, announced on Thursday, was Meta&#39;s second-largest investment to date. It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition.

The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors&#39; access to Scale&#39;s services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals&#39; operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet&#39;s Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta&#39;s stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back.

In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.

Alexandr Wang, Scale&#39;s 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale&#39;s board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed.

Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University.

Trump&#39;s antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added.

&#34;That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,&#34; Kovacic said.

Federal Trade Commission probes into past &#34;aquihire&#34; deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon&#39;s deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft&#39;s $650 million deal with Inflection AI. The latter allowed Microsoft to use Inflection&#39;s models and hire most of the startup&#39;s staff, including its co-founders.</p>

Wang will leave his day-to-day role at Scale to focus on AI initiatives at Meta while remaining on Scale&#39;s board. The deal comes after reports that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew frustrated with the pace of internal AI development, delaying the launch of its latest Llama 4 model amid questions over its advancements.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.

Meta is forming a superintelligence group near Zuckerberg&#39;s Menlo Park office to speed up breakthroughs. Scale AI, known for data annotation and training tools essential for machine learning, will continue its operations under board oversight.

Analysts say the tie-up could help Meta enhance model training and data pipelines, narrowing gaps with rivals that have poured resources into large language models and infrastructure.

However, execution risks remain, as integrating teams and delivering measurable AI improvements can be challenging. Investors will track how Scale&#39;s expertise influences Meta&#39;s AI roadmap and whether this move accelerates product enhancements and supports long-term innovation.

Over the last quarter, Meta&#39;s stock increased by 14%, a move possibly fortified by these strategic endeavors amid a market environment that saw broader gains. Despite market volatility due to geopolitical tensions, Meta&#39;s focus on AI and renewable energy potentially supported its stock performance. The market conditions included a 1.6% rise over the past week, with tech stocks like Meta experiencing mixed reactions.

The best AI stocks today may lie beyond giants like Nvidia and Microsoft. Find the next big opportunity with these 25 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.

Meta Platforms&#39; recent investment in Scale AI and collaboration with XGS Energy may bolster its AI and renewable energy initiatives, potentially driving both revenue and earnings. The focus on enhancing digital engagement through AI innovations could lead to better ad targeting and more personalized user experiences, supporting future revenue streams. This aligns with analysts&#39; forecasts indicating potential revenue growth, although challenges like operational hurdles in Europe and Reality Labs&#39; losses could temper profit margins.

Over the past three years, Meta&#39;s total shareholder return was very large at 333.04%, indicating significant growth when considering both its stock price movement and dividends. Within the last year, Meta has outperformed the US Interactive Media and Services industry, which saw a 12.7% increase. This suggests strong relative performance over a shorter timeframe.

The company&#39;s share price has recently increased 14% this quarter, but still trades at a discount to the consensus price target, which is 16.6% higher at US$703.89. This price movement suggests room for further upside if Meta successfully executes on its strategic initiatives. However, investors should consider the risks around AI investments and European regulatory changes that could impact future earnings forecasts. By subscribing to analyst expectations, which assume an increase in revenue to US$243.6 billion by 2028, stakeholders should continually assess these factors in relation to Meta&#39;s projected performance and valuation.</p>

While Meta didn&#39;t disclose the deal value, the investment reportedly lifts Scale&#39;s valuation to more than $29 billion. Alongside the investment, Scale&#39;s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping into a role on Meta&#39;s elite superintelligence teamthe group tasked with building artificial general intelligence. Wang will remain on Scale&#39;s board, while former Uber executive Jason Droege takes over as interim CEO.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.

The move reflects growing urgency inside Meta. After the lukewarm reception of Llama 4, Mark Zuckerberg has taken a far more hands-on role in the company&#39;s AI directionpersonally recruiting top researchers, reshuffling office layouts to bring the new AGI team closer to his desk, and stepping up compensation offers to lure talent away from Alphabet and startups like Sesame AI. While Big Tech rivals like Microsoft and Amazon have already made deep bets on AI startups, Meta&#39;s partnership with Scale could serve a dual purpose: speeding up its AI model development while also deepening ties to U.S. government agencies where Scale has strong traction.

Unlike OpenAI and Anthropic, Scale isn&#39;t building foundation modelsit&#39;s focused on data labeling and training infrastructure that underpins nearly every major AI effort, including Meta&#39;s. The company expects $2 billion in revenue this year, up from $870 million in 2024. For Meta, the deal could be a way to close the gap with leaders in the field without triggering the antitrust scrutiny that comes with acquisitions. As Wolfe Research&#39;s Shweta Khajuria put it, An investment this aggressive implies not only that it&#39;s important to the company, but that they need it.

Scale AI said Meta has made a &#34;significant new investment&#34; in the company that values the startup at $29 billion.

As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on artificial intelligence efforts.

The move comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been frustrated with the Facebook parent&#39;s level of AI progress.



Artificial intelligence startup Scale AI said it received a “significant new investment” from Meta (META) that values the company at more than $29 billion and sees its chief executive join the tech titan.

CEO Alexandr Wang posted on X that he will leave his role at Scale to work on Meta’s AI efforts, while remaining on the startup&#39;s board.

The move comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been frustrated with the company’s level of AI progress. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported Meta was pushing back the launch of its latest Llama 4 large language model amid concerns about whether enough improvements had been made compared to previous iterations.

To speed up development, Zuckerberg is reportedly working to build what has been referred to internally at Meta as a &#34;superintelligence group&#34; that will sit near him at Meta&#39;s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.

Shares of Meta are little changed in recent trading. The stock is up 18% for 2025.

Both its initial smaller first phase and its larger second phase will be operational by 2030.

Both will be located on the site of the state&#39;s PNM public service electric grid.

The agreement represents another step for Meta, one of the world&#39;s largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy.

Meta global head of energy Urvi Parekh stated: “Advances in AI require continued energy to support infrastructure development.

“With next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS ready for scale, geothermal can be a major player in supporting the advancement of technologies like AI as well as domestic data centre development.

“We’re excited to partner with XGS to unlock a new category of energy supply for our operations in New Mexico.”

The energy company’s geothermal technology will be deployed to the PNM electric grid and will support the tech company’s data centre operations, which are located in New Mexico.

XGS’s tech has separated geothermal energy production from traditional constraints by eliminating the need for specific geological conditions such as water availability or permeable rock formations.

Currently, New Mexico has only one operational geothermal power plant despite having some of the most promising hot rock resources nationwide.

The new project is expected to raise New Mexico&#39;s total output of geothermal electricity tenfold.

XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher stated: “We’re pleased to support Meta’s ambitious AI objectives and accelerate access to new round-the-clock power supplies.

“More broadly, the state of New Mexico is a growing hub for data centre development. We are eager to feed clean, water-independent geothermal power into the New Mexico market at a scale uniquely possible with XGS technology.”

Constellation and Meta recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to use the output from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, US.

The deal supports Meta’s clean energy objectives and regional operations by providing 1,121MW (1.12GW) of emissions-free nuclear energy.

This investment will see Scale AI&#39;s founder, Alexandr Wang, take on a leadership role at Meta, where he will oversee the company&#39;s AI initiatives while retaining his position on Scale AI&#39;s board of directors.

Recently, Meta Platforms reportedly agreed to acquire a 49% stake in the US-based AI startup for $14.8bn.

Sources familiar with the negotiations, as reported by Reuters, suggest that the primary aim of this investment is to secure Wang&#39;s expertise to lead Meta&#39;s new superintelligence unit.

The partnership aims to enhance the existing commercial relationship between Meta and Scale AI, facilitating the rapid deployment of Scale&#39;s data solutions.

Following the investment, Scale AI has appointed Jason Droege, its chief strategy officer, as interim CEO.

Droege, who joined Scale in September 2024, brings over two decades of experience from companies such as Uber Eats and Axon.

Droege said: “Meta’s new investment and our broadened commercial agreement is a testament to the incredible work and dedication of the entire Scale team, and the tremendous upside that lies ahead for Scale.”

According to Scale AI, the funds from the investment will be used to drive “innovation” and strengthen strategic partnerships with clients.

The company plans to distribute a portion of the proceeds to its shareholders and vested equity holders, providing liquidity while allowing them to maintain their stakes in Scale.

Following the investment, Meta will hold a minority interest in Scale AI&#39;s outstanding equity.

The company will continue to collaborate with AI laboratories, multinational corporations, and government entities to provide data and technology solutions as the field of AI evolves.

In a statement, Wang said: “AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time, with unlimited possibility and far-reaching influence on how people, businesses and governments succeed.

“Scale bridges the gap between human values and technology to help our customers realise AI’s full potential. Meta’s investment recognises Scale’s accomplishments to date and reaffirms that our path forward – like that of AI – is limitless.”

The white-on-black statement, published a day after the president’s inauguration, was the handiwork of Alexandr Wang, a 28-year-old billionaire and new AI wunderkind behind the start-up Scale AI.

While not as well-known as OpenAI, the business behind ChatGPT, Wang’s Scale AI has emerged as one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) groups in Silicon Valley and made Wang the new star of the US tech scene.

Wang, whose youth masks his skills as a savvy operator and networker, is starting to make his mark on the global stage, receiving an invite to attend Donald Trump’s swearing-in on Jan 20 and meeting Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, to discuss the future of AI.

Now he has been courted by US tech royalty, namely Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, who has invested $15bn (£11bn) in Wang’s business and brought him into Meta to lead a new “super-intelligence” team.

Scale AI said in a blog post on Friday that Wang would be leaving to join Meta full-time.

Born to Chinese immigrant parents in New Mexico, Wang co-founded Scale AI in 2016 alongside Lucy Guo, now the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire, who recently told The Telegraph about the struggles of starting the company.

The business provides complex tech services – namely data labelling and AI evaluation – to other technology companies. Accessing vast amounts of high-quality data is increasingly seen as crucial to improving AI technology.

Exploiting this niche made Wang the world’s youngest billionaire in 2021, aged just 24. His net worth is currently estimated at more than $3bn.

Scale AI has been so successful because it uses technology and people to help mark-up and review images, videos or text that are used by other AI labs to develop their latest algorithms.

It also provides a type of “training” for AI algorithms, known as “reinforcement learning with human feedback”, which it sells to other labs, where human workers help optimise responses from chatbots or other AI tools.

Increasingly, Scale AI has turned to expert contractors who can help chatbots learn advanced coding, maths or chemistry. The business says it has access to 100,000 expert freelancers, to whom it has paid $500m in total.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hit a new all-time high early on Wednesday -- making it the only company at the moment valued at a market cap over $3.5 trillion.

Investors wondering which &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; stock could be next to have come to the right place. Here&#39;s the case for why Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could follow in Microsoft&#39;s footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now.

The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft and hit all-time highs is because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs.

Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it&#39;s a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come.

Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries.

Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins.

Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company&#39;s Family of Apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok.

It wasn&#39;t long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company&#39;s compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company&#39;s main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations.</p>

The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).

Meta announced what it called a “strategic partnership and investment” with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.

Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will “substantially expand Scale and Meta’s commercial relationship.” Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.

Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale’s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company’s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats (UBER) and Axon.

Zuckerberg&#39;s increasing focus on the abstract idea of “superintelligence” — which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI — is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company&#39;s name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.

It won&#39;t be the first time since ChatGPT&#39;s 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft (MSFT) hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft&#39;s AI division.

Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon (AMZN) made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept’s AI systems and datasets.

Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.

They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.

Scale&#39;s pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what&#39;s in front of them. General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM, 7203.T) have been among Scale&#39;s customers.</p>

(Reuters) -Facebook-owner Meta has invested in Scale AI in a deal that values the data-labeling startup at $29 billion and brings in its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to play a prominent role in the tech giant&#39;s artificial intelligence strategy.

Meta will take a 49% stake for $14.3 billion, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

&#34;We will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts,&#34; Meta said in a statement that did not disclose financial terms.

The main driver for Meta&#39;s substantial investment in Scale was to secure Wang to lead its new superintelligence unit, according to a separate source briefed on the discussions.

The sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. Meta didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Wang, who was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to Chinese immigrant physicists, dropped out of MIT to co-found Scale. He was quickly lauded as one of Silicon Valley&#39;s most promising entrepreneurs, raising funding from blue-chip venture capital firms and achieving billionaire status in his 20s.

He has also cultivated relationships with top tech executives such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and has since leveraged his influence to build connections in Washington D.C., testifying in front of Congress and securing the federal government as a big client.

Meta, once recognized as a leader in open-source AI models, has suffered from staff departures and has postponed the launches of new open-source AI models that could rival competitors like Google, OpenAI, and China&#39;s DeepSeek.

By poaching Wang, who does not come from a research background but has built a major AI business, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is betting that Meta&#39;s AI efforts can be turned around by an adept business leader more in the mold of Altman than the research scientists at the helm of most competing labs.

Scale said the deal values it at $29 billion and that its chief strategy officer, Jason Droege, will serve as its interim CEO.

The social media giant doesn&#39;t plan to take a board seat in Scale, one of the sources added.

A few employees from Scale, a company with 1,500 people, will join Wang in moving to Meta, Wang said in a note to employees on Thursday. Wang will remain on Scale&#39;s board.

The cash investment would rank as Meta&#39;s second-largest ever after its $19 billion buyout of WhatsApp.

It&#39;s unclear if this deal will come under any regulatory scrutiny. Meta has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which alleges it illegally acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to stifle competition.</p>

Meta said Thursday that it has backed Scale, without including details. The size of the investment was $14.3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal values the startup at more than $29 billion, including the money raised, Scale said in a blog post Thursday.

As part of the investment, Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang is set to take on a new role at Meta on its AI team. Wang will join the company’s “superintelligence” unit, focused on building AI that performs as well as humans, a hypothetical advance often referred to as artificial general intelligence. Wang will stay on at Scale as a board member.

“Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI,” a Meta spokesperson said. “As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models.”

Meta will take a 49% stake in the company, said the person familiar, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Meta is purchasing nonvoting shares. Bloomberg News previously reported Meta was in talks with Scale.

In a statement on Thursday, Wang said that the investment “recognizes Scale’s accomplishments” and underscores the importance of AI technology. “AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time, with unlimited possibility and far-reaching influence on how people, businesses and governments succeed,” he said.

Scale’s new interim CEO will be Jason Droege. In a statement, the company said that even after its Meta partnership, “Scale remains an independent leader in AI, committed to providing industry-leading AI solutions and safeguarding customer data.”

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, has made AI the top focus at his social networking company this year, earmarking tens of billions of dollars for AI-related infrastructure and hiring. But Zuckerberg has grown frustrated with Meta’s progress following the rollout of the company’s latest large language model, Llama 4, which was widely viewed as underwhelming.</p>

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Meta signed an agreement with XGS Energy to help develop 150 megawatts of advanced geothermal electricity in New Mexico to power the Facebook parent company&#39;s artificial intelligence expansion, the companies said on Thursday.

WHY IT&#39;S IMPORTANT

Giant technology companies like Meta are striking unprecedented power deals to secure massive amounts of electricity for the data centers needed to develop AI, which is a top driver of the record U.S. power consumption projected for 2025 and 2026.

Geothermal energy, which does not produce climate-warming carbon emissions, has become a popular source of electricity for Big Tech companies, many of which have emissions reduction goals. Unlike conventional geothermal power production, advanced geothermal does not rely on natural water sources.

Last year, Google announced plans to fuel its data centers with advanced geothermal power produced by Fervo Energy.

CONTEXT

While 150 megawatts is a tiny fraction of the many gigawatts of power sought by technology companies to power AI, it would represent about 4% of total U.S. geothermal production.

New Mexico, which lays claim to a section of the world&#39;s largest shale oil basin, has 160,000 megawatts of untapped geothermal power generation potential.

The phased-in project between XGS and Meta is projected to be operational by the end of the decade. The advanced geothermal electricity will be deployed to the electric grid and support Meta&#39;s operations in the state.

KEY QUOTE

“With next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS ready for scale, geothermal can be a major player in supporting the advancement of technologies like AI as well as domestic data center development,&#34; Urvi Parekh, Global Head of Energy at Meta said in a written statement.

&#34;We’re excited to partner with XGS to unlock a new category of energy supply for our operations in New Mexico,” she said.

That’s what Tesla CEO Elon Musk said after revealing the company’s robotaxi test would start on June 22, later than expected, adding that the date could “shift” beyond that. Meanwhile, betting site Polymarket lists only a 30% chance that Tesla (TSLA) launches the service before July, highlighting Musk&#39;s rosy predictions on self-driving that have been constantly pushed back.

While Tesla is on the verge of starting a new chapter for the company, Alphabet’s (GOOG) Waymo has been quietly racking up mile after mile, trip after trip, providing actual paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin — where Tesla’s test will begin.

At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently, but could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.

Waymo has an early lead, and it seems a big one. Rivals like Argo AI and GM-backed Cruise are gone, leaving only smaller players like Zoox (backed by Amazon), China’s Pony AI (PONY), and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla.

Waymo (before it was even called that) started off as an in-house startup as part of Google’s X initiative way back in 2009.

After some testing and securing of permits, the project officially became Waymo in 2016, and it started testing its Pacifica hybrid vans kitted out with cameras, LIDAR laser sensors, and radar.

In 2018 Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker’s I-Pace EV for its testing; these are the vehicles most users are accustomed to seeing.

Waymo&#39;s combination of vision, radar, and LIDAR, which the company calls its “multimodal” approach, has the company claiming it has the best and safest robotaxi solution.

Since 2020, anyone in a service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that the company performs around 250,000 trips a week.

A Waymo spokesperson said that the company has not yet seen a vision-only system that can achieve the levels of safety its current system has achieved, asserting that multiple sensors with overlapping fields of view are the best solution.

Experts tend to agree.

“Waymo is undoubtedly the leader in autonomous driving technology, with their self-driving software (SDS) being widely regarded as best in class,” said University of San Francisco engineering professor William Riggs, an expert in autonomous technology. “They have been around the longest, had patient capital, and have the most miles on the road proving that self-driving tech works.”</p>

You might remember that Tesla had been slashing prices left and right through 2023 and into early &#39;24including a $2,000 trim on these very same modelsbut with rivals like Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stepping their game up, and U.S. incentives waning, Elon and co. clearly decided it was time to lean into premium positioning again. The fresh pricing follows a facelift: new interior touches, longer range figures and some slick driver-assist tweaks that, Tesla argues, justify the hike.

Despite the bells and whistles, the market wasn&#39;t thrilledTSLA dipped about 2.2% in premarket trading and is still nursing a 21% slump for the year. Analysts reckon if Tesla holds its volume, this move could tack on roughly half a billion dollars in annual revenue, but demand elasticity in a high-rate, competitive EV world is the million-dollar question.

Why It Matters: Juicing prices tells you Tesla believes its upgraded sedans and SUVs can command a premium, but we&#39;ll soon see if buyers bite or start shopping elsewhere.

These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up this week, climbing 10.3% as of market close on Friday. The rise came as the S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) both sank modestly.

Tesla stock recovered this week after the public spat between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump cooled.

Last week, Musk and Trump found themselves in a very public spat. What began as criticism of Trump&#39;s flagship &#34;Big, Beautiful Bill&#34; escalated into personal attacks and serious accusations. Musk deleted his most incendiary post and apologized on X, saying that some of his posts last week had gone &#34;too far.&#34; The de-escalation of the situation sent Tesla stock higher.

The stock was also on the rise this week in anticipation of Tesla&#39;s reported robotaxi launch. According to a report from Bloomberg, Tesla was set to begin operating its vehicles autonomously in Austin, Texas, on June 12. However, it&#39;s now clear that the company has pushed back this date, now targeting June 22. Despite the delay, Tesla shares were up further on Friday.

This is not the first time the company has failed to meet a target launch date or milestone for its autonomous driving technology. Musk previously said he was &#34;very confident predicting&#34; that there would be 1 million of his robotaxis on the roads no later than &#34;next year&#34; -- in 2019. I am dubious of the company&#39;s ability to deliver on its promises, and given the state of its current vehicle sales (which are seeing massive declines), I think this stock is extremely overvalued.

Even after a year-to-date decline for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, Elon Musk is still significantly ahead of who is in second place and worth more than several of his automotive rivals combined.

What Happened: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the world&#39;s richest person and gets the majority of his net worth from ownership stakes in the electric vehicle company, SpaceX, xAI and other ventures.

Musk currently ranks first as the world&#39;s richest with a wealth of $369 billion according to Bloomberg.

Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.

This is significantly ahead of the billionaire in second place, Mark Zuckerberg, who is worth an estimated $245 billion.

What&#39;s also interesting is that if you look at Musk&#39;s wealth, it’s worth more than several of the largest automotive companies combined.

Take this list, for example:

Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA): $29.7 billion

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F): $41.9 billion

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM): $47.4 billion

Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM): $238.2 billion

Add it up and it&#39;s a value of $357.2 billion. That means Musk is worth more than these four automotive companies combined, with $11.8 billion left over.

Why It&#39;s Important: Musk and Tesla have dominated the electric vehicle market in the U.S. and globally.

Tesla is worth over $1 trillion, even with recent struggles with delivery figures and demand.

A recent public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump sent shares of Tesla down significantly, marking the company’s biggest one-day market capitalization loss of $152 billion.

That drop also sent the wealth of Musk from $368 billion on June 4 to $335 billion on June 5.

Tesla stock and Musk&#39;s wealth have rebounded from that feud-related sell-off.

Tesla stock remains down 15.9% year-to-date.

Musk&#39;s wealth has taken a hit in 2025 with a $63.5 billion drop in his net worth over the year. This comes with Tesla stock falling, while other ventures of his such as Neuralink, xAI and SpaceX are seeing higher valuations.

Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $400 billion in late 2024 and he could be headed back to that figure if Tesla stock can rally on recent robotaxi news and turn positive on the year.</p>

The world of self-driving cars is quickly evolving, as a leading automaker prepares for a historic event.

After months of teasing it, Tesla  (TSLA)  is preparing to officially roll out its fleet of autonomous vehicles in Austin, Texas, and its loyal fans are watching closely. CEO Elon Musk has hinged a lot on this self-driving technology, as the company works to usher in a turnaround after months of volatility.

Despite all the recent focus on the Tesla robotaxi debut, Musk’s company isn’t the only automaker that’s been working hard to pull ahead in the driverless race. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, has successfully put self-driving cars on the road in multiple major cities.

Now, a new report has highlighted some of the economics of the self-driving car market, providing key insights into a key area that sparked concern among some financial experts.

As areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced in recent years, the rise of self-driving vehicles has seemed inevitable. Elon Musk, known for his focus on futuristic technology, has helped champion it, even though Tesla is currently still behind Waymo in the driverless race.

Granted, that may change as Tesla’s robotaxi offically enter the market. They won’t be operating fully autonomously, however, as the cars will come with a teleoperator standing by to assist if necessary. As experts have told TheStreet, this means they can’t be considered fully self-driving.

The industry recently received some good news that suggests Waymo is in an excellent position to continue expanding. Market research Obi has published a report on the state of the industry, providing a detailed analysis of its economic elements, with a focus on Waymo, Uber  (UBER) , and Lyft.

The report’s authors highlight Waymo’s undeniable growing presence in San Francisco, a city synonymous with technology and innovation. They also reveal a shocking statistic that bodes extremely well for self-driving technology adoption, but specifically for Waymo: consumers are very willing to pay for a driverless experience.</p>

As a result, there is a big picture about Tesla that many are missing.

Three years ago, fans of Tesla were certainly much more excited about their automotive manufacturing business than they are today. Back then, quick EV adoption appeared inevitable, Tesla had the technological lead and the overwhelming market share lead in EVs.

A great deal has changed since.

First, overall demand for pure battery electric vehicles (BEVs) turned out not to be as high as investors expected. Tesla consequently was forced to cut prices, which pressured margins. Moreover, expected new model launches at Telsa never materialized (or were “delayed”— much like the anticipated debut of Tesla’s robotaxi program earlier this week).

Meanwhile, Musk’s dalliance and subsequent reversal of fortunes with Trump and MAGA simultaneously confused Tesla’s core customer base.  In the views of one of our close friends, “Musk attempted to appeal to a F-150 and Ram crowd that hates his cars, while completely losing the Tesla crowd that loved his cars.”

Meanwhile, the amount of U.S. government subsidies that Tesla directly and indirectly receives is staggering.  Consequently, Musk may be accelerating pressure on the large subsidies enjoyed by Tesla buyers (federal tax credits, which indirectly go straight into Tesla’s pockets) as well as the subsidies enjoyed by the company directly (in the form of regulatory credits).

Finally, and at the worst possible time for Tesla, traditional competitors have started ramping up with marketable EVs, and new competitors (especially in China) started developing products too, with tremendous success.</p>

According to Bloomberg, the Trump administration is streamlining the exemption process for automakers seeking to deploy self-driving cars designed without traditional steering wheels or brake pedals. This regulatory shift could significantly benefit Tesla’s ambitions to launch its robotaxi service.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it will simplify the exemption procedure, which previously resulted in processing times that could stretch for years. In a letter posted to its website on Friday, NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser stated the agency &#34;anticipates reaching decisions on most exemption requests within months rather than years.&#34;

Current federal safety standards effectively require new vehicles to include human driving controls, forcing companies developing autonomous vehicles to seek exemptions - a process that has created substantial delays for manufacturers.

While Tesla shares climbed on the news, ride-hailing companies Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) saw their shares edge lower, potentially reflecting investor concerns about future competition from autonomous taxi services.

The regulatory changes align with Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s previously announced plans to develop a fleet of self-driving &#34;Cybercabs&#34; that could compete directly with traditional ride-sharing services.

Tesla shares this week have recovered most of the ground lost in the wake of Elon Musk&#39;s social media fight with President Donald Trump.

The back and forth culminated with Tesla losing $150 million in market cap in one day.

Shares of Tesla have been on a roller coaster this year, and they currently sit down about 20% for 2025.



Tesla (TSLA) shares have risen this week as investors may be moving past the fiery public spat between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

The electric vehicle maker’s shares are up 10% this week, recouping more than half of the ground lost last week in the wake of Trump and Musk’s social media shots at one another. The back and forth started as an argument over Trump’s “Big Beautiful” taxation-and-spending bill but spiraled into a now-deleted post in which Musk accused Trump of being in the &#34;Epstein files,&#34; referencing the late convicted sex trafficker. The public fight ended up costing Tesla a spot in the illustrious $1 trillion market capitalization club with a one-day drop of more than $150 billion.

This week has seen a cooling of tensions, at least on social media, with Musk admitting he regrets some of his posts. He also reposted Trump&#39;s criticism of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Tesla&#39;s stock has been on a roller coaster ride this year. Shares shed more than 35% of their value in the first quarter as sales slumped, tariffs hit the stock market, and controversy swirled around Musk. They staged a comeback in April and May after Musk said he would step back from Washington.

Shares climbed close to 2% Friday, and currently sit down about 20% for 2025.

Sher was already a user of the car-sharing platform Turo, and the idea of turning a Tesla into an even bigger moneymaker was an attractive proposition.

But as years went by, Musk failed to follow through on that promise. So, in 2021, Sher assembled a small team and brought on co-founder Saimah Chaudhry to start his own company. “Hey, we’re just going to do this ourselves,” he thought at the time.

What they built was a new peer-to-peer car-sharing startup called Zevo, which is broadly similar to Turo, but focused exclusively on electric vehicles.

The Dallas-based startup has been in operation for around 10 months, and on Friday it announced it has raised $6 million in funding as it looks to expand across more major U.S. cities. Sher told TechCrunch that Zevo is already tracking over $8 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), and has a wait list of more than 3,500 customers — all with essentially no marketing to date.

On the renter side, an overwhelming portion of that interest is coming from gig workers, Sher said. Some 90% of people using Zevo to rent an EV are doing so to ferry passengers on Uber or Lyft, or make DoorDash deliveries.

Sher said he thinks Zevo has “the secret sauce on how to make car sharing very lucrative for the host and very affordable for the renter.”

So what’s the secret sauce?

“It’s gonna sound crazy, but the secret sauce is not raising hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to build something that can be a powerful marketplace,” Sher said. “We very intentionally raised private capital. We rejected VC capital for that reason. I didn’t want to be on a 12-month to 18-month runway of ‘spend, spend, spend, spend,’ which is how corporate America likes to do things in this world.”

Bootstrapping Zevo allowed Sher to gather good engineers, develop a strong go-to-market strategy, and cause “true disruption,” he said.

By keeping things focused, Sher said Zevo is able to send more money to the vehicle owners than they’d get on platforms like Turo.

Sher also talked up Zevo’s “contactless” process, which allows owners and renters to share a car without having to hand over keys or key cards.

That’s not novel — plenty of other car-sharing services have adopted a similar contactless process. But Sher argued that Zevo’s contactless nature is front-and-center because the service only uses EVs, which tend to be more technologically capable and therefore easier to integrate in a smartphone app.</p>

The People&#39;s Bank of China reported nearly 1.5 trillion yuan ($204 billion) in government bonds were sold last month, roughly 20% higher than a year ago. That marks the third time in 2025 bond sales have topped 1 trillion yuan in a single month. The surge helped lift total aggregate financing to 2.29 trillion yuan, an increase from 2 trillion yuan in May 2024.

On the ground, though, the appetite for new borrowing looks subdued. Households took out just 54 billion yuan in new loans last month, bringing the year-to-date total to 572 billion yuanthe lowest since at least 2009. New loans from financial institutions also fell, landing at 620 billion yuan, well below last year&#39;s 945 billion yuan for the same period. This comes even after the PBOC announced sweeping monetary easing in early May, including across-the-board rate cuts and liquidity moves that could inject 2.1 trillion yuan into the economy.

According to Bloomberg Economics&#39; Eric Zhu, May&#39;s numbers suggest the government is delivering on its stimulus plans, but the response from households and businesses remains cautious. For global investors watching China&#39;s recovery story, the next leg of growth may depend on whether demand strengthens beyond public-sector activity. Companies with strong exposure to the Chinese consumer, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), could be watching for early signs of a turn in private-sector sentiment.

This in-house platform features a more powerful computing system than that used in Rivian&#39;s earlier vehicles and is tailored specifically for its current and future models.

RAP provides Level 2+ autonomy, meaning it supports the driver with alerts and interventions, such as steering corrections and emergency braking, but it never takes full control of the vehicle. The system includes a comprehensive set of ADAS tools, stepping in only when necessary.

Standard on the R1T and R1S models, RAP’s features fall into two main categories: Driving Assist and Active Safety Assist. Driving Assist includes user-activated tools like Highway Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane-Change Assistance. Active Safety Assist includes automatic features aimed at preventing accidents, such as lane safety, lighting adjustments, parking and reversing aids, and collision mitigation. RIVN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

With the introduction of its second-generation R1 platform, Rivian has significantly upgraded RAP. The vehicles now use a revamped perception system and computing setup, including 55-megapixel cameras and onboard processing power exceeding 200 trillion operations per second. The platform’s AI-driven design and vertically integrated hardware allow Rivian to efficiently collect and process high-quality, multi-modal sensor data, giving it a competitive edge in ADAS development. Other automakers like Toyota Motor Corporation TM and Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Tesla TSLA are also making progress on the development of their respective autonomous vehicle platforms.

In April, Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo reached a preliminary agreement to explore a collaboration focused on the development of a new autonomous vehicle platform. Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo aim to combine their respective strengths to develop the platform. In parallel, the companies will explore how to leverage Waymo&#39;s autonomous technology and Toyota&#39;s vehicle expertise to enhance next-generation personally owned vehicles. 

Tesla&#39;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is a sophisticated driver-assistance technology designed to allow Tesla cars to navigate various driving conditions autonomously. FSD builds on Tesla’s existing Autopilot features and is sold as an optional upgrade. The company has long been a leader in autonomous vehicle development. Tesla released its last major FSD update, v13, in December 2024.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›

Everyone wants to invest in the next Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and an examination of analyst predictions suggests Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) has the potential to be it. Sales are expected to grow by 73% this year, with another 96% growth expected in 2026.

There&#39;s just one problem with buying the stock at the moment: Lucid shares trade at 6.7 times sales, a pricey valuation for a business that might be unprofitable for at least the next several years. If you dig deeper, however, Lucid shares might be wildly undervalued despite the high price-to-sales ratio (P/S).

Despite generating less than 1% of Tesla&#39;s revenue, Lucid Group still trades at roughly half the valuation of Tesla on a price-to-sales basis. That could all change when the company releases its &#34;mass market&#34; vehicles. Management has previously teased three new vehicle models that will all sell for less than $50,000 a piece.

While these vehicles are still a year or two away from production, they should eventually put Lucid&#39;s growth in overdrive. Tesla released its Model 3 in 2017, with the Model Y following in 2020. These two affordable vehicles now account for more than 90% of Tesla&#39;s sales -- the primary reason that Tesla&#39;s sales have gone from a few billion dollars to more than $95 billion today.

Lucid has a very long way to go before matching Tesla&#39;s revenue numbers. But releasing more affordable models is the key to closing the gap. If management is to be believed, the first of several mass market models will arrive sometime in 2026, with more on the way in 2027 and beyond.

It should be stressed that Lucid&#39;s financial position isn&#39;t incredibly strong right now. It has less than $1.9 billion in cash on the balance sheet, yet it lost nearly $2.4 billion over the last 12 months.

More cash will need to be raised to get these new models to market. However, Tesla&#39;s success shows Lucid&#39;s true potential.

&#34;AP7 has decided to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of labor rights in the United States,&#34; the pension fund said in a statement.

&#34;Despite several years of dialogue with Tesla, including shareholder proposals in collaboration with other investors, the company has not taken sufficient measures to address the issues,&#34; it added.

An AP7 spokesperson said the fund&#39;s stake in Tesla was, when it was sold in late May, worth around 13 billion crowns ($1.36 billion). At the time, the stake represented around 1% of the AP7 Equity Fund, the spokesperson said.

The fund&#39;s assets totalled 1,181 billion crowns at the end of May, according to AP7&#39;s website.

($1 = 9.5285 Swedish crowns)

(NYSE:BRK.A) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.

Although we don&#39;t think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

The Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations &amp; Director, Ajit Jain, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$139m worth of shares at a price of US$695,418 each. So it&#39;s clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$767,200. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can&#39;t be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it&#39;s only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 63% of Ajit Jain&#39;s holding.

Berkshire Hathaway insiders didn&#39;t buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!

For those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Berkshire Hathaway insiders own 15% of the company, currently worth about US$163b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.</p>

Although Berkshire Hathaway has shed US$36b from its market cap this week, let&#39;s take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they&#39;ve driven returns.

To quote Buffett, &#39;Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...&#39; One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company&#39;s share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During five years of share price growth, Berkshire Hathaway achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 56% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We&#39;re pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It&#39;s always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s earnings, revenue and cash flow.

We&#39;re pleased to report that Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 23% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we&#39;ve identified 1 warning sign for Berkshire Hathaway that you should be aware of.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) blasted to a new all-time high on May 2 just in time for its 60th annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last Saturday.

The stock is crushing the S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) year to date. It&#39;s up 14%, compared to a 4.5% decline in the index. The winning streak goes beyond the past few months. Berkshire has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during the past year and past three years, and has nearly tripled during the past five years while the S&amp;P 500 has doubled.

The gains come even as Berkshire has been reducing its investments in equity securities and building up its cash position. Last year, Berkshire cut its holdings in its largest position, Apple, by roughly two-thirds and slashed its Bank of America stock holdings, which was its second-largest position.

On Saturday, Berkshire released its first-quarter 2025 results, which showed a 14% decline in operating earnings.

With the stock up a lot, and earnings down, investors may be getting concerned about Berkshire&#39;s valuation. Let&#39;s dive into the results and some key comments from Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett during the annual meeting to see if the value stock is worth buying.

Berkshire can be divided into three basic categories -- the value of its controlled businesses, investments in equity securities, and its cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills (T-bills), which are usually referred to simply as its cash position since Treasury bills are liquid.

As of March 31, Berkshire&#39;s cash position was $347.68 billion. As of May 2, the market value of Berkshire&#39;s equity securities -- which consists of positions in public companies like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola -- was worth $277.41 billion, and its market cap was $1.163 trillion. That means the market values the rest of its controlled businesses at $537.9 billion.

Berkshire&#39;s composition has changed dramatically. Consider that just three years ago, as of March 31, 2022, Berkshire&#39;s cash position was $106.26 billion, its equity securities were valued at a whopping $390.54 billion, and its market cap was $778.63 billion -- meaning the value of its controlled companies was just $281.83 billion.

Now, if Berkshire had some splashy acquisition that made a meaningful contribution to operating earnings during the past few years, then it would make sense why its controlled companies would be worth so much more. But Berkshire hasn&#39;t done that. It has made a few moves here and there, like buying the remaining 8% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion. But that&#39;s not enough to move the needle by hundreds of billions of dollars in just a few years.</p>

Yahoo Finance markets and data editor Jared Blikre — who also hosts the Stocks In Translation podcast — lays out Berkshire&#39;s holdings across each sector and how these allocations stack up to the S&amp;P 500.

At the company&#39;s annual shareholders meeting in May, Buffett, 94, announced his plans to step down as chief executive at the end of 2025, to be succeeded by Berkshire Hathaway Energy Chair Greg Abel.

No Major Changes Anticipated

Buffett was expected to relinquish the CEO position to his successor, Greg Abel, at some point, but the timing of the move was previously unknown, UBS noted.

Nonetheless, Berkshire had already begun relying less on Buffett&#39;s investing acumen, as the conglomerate has many extremely profitable businesses that are unrelated to its portfolio of stocks, the bank pointed out.

UBS expects Abel to refrain from making any significant changes to the company&#39;s operations, culture, and strategy.

Berkshire&#39;s Other Positive Attributes

UBS noted that the conglomerate has a great deal of capital. Additionally, its many businesses which operate in a multitude of fields, provide it with a great deal of information that it can use to help it make investment decisions, according to UBS.

As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space

A Bloomberg gauge of the US dollar gained as much as 0.6% at one point on Friday after Israel’s attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. However, the currency pared much of its advance and closed some 0.2% higher in New York.

The modest recovery leaves the greenback just above the three-year low it hit this week after President Donald Trump threatened fresh levies against global trading partners. The dollar has slid during the past five months as Trump pushed ahead with tariffs, which have raised concerns over the US economic outlook and fueled speculation that foreigners will shun American assets — the so-called Sell America trade.

“Middle East tensions are a risk to navigate rather than a game changer for the bearish dollar view,” JPMorgan strategists including Meera Chandan and Arindam Sandilya said to clients in a note Friday. “We do not expect the dollar impact to be more pronounced or durable than this at this stage.”

The day’s trading pattern was a far cry from decades past, when international crises would typically fuel gains in the greenback and Treasuries, long considered havens in part because of their liquidity and confidence in the US as a leader in the global economy.

The 10-year US Treasury yield rose about five basis points on Friday as surging oil prices stoked inflation worries.

There are some signs that the gloomy stance toward the dollar is easing a bit. For example, options traders — while still broadly bearish on the US currency’s prospects — have moderated their negative views in recent weeks and are banking on a pause in the greenback’s sharp decline.

“The source of shocks to global risk and growth have been more concentrated in the US so far this year,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists Stuart Jenkins, Kamakshya Trivedi and Teresa Alves said in a report to clients on Friday. “If that source were to shift more to the rest of the world, the dollar may resume trading with more safe-haven type characteristics.”

The US’s position as the world’s largest oil producer likely helped buoy the dollar on Friday as crude futures soared, analysts said. So did the possibility of a squeeze in short positions against the greenback.</p>

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock&#39;s performance in the near future.

Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&#39;s +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. falls in, has gained 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock&#39;s future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually make its stock &#39;trending&#39; and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company&#39;s future earnings over anything else. That&#39;s because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock&#39;s fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is expected to post earnings of $4.45 per share, indicating a change of +1.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.36 points to a change of -7%. from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.32 indicates a change of +5.2% from what JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock&#39;s near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co..</p>

Oil prices advanced as much as 13% in the aftermath of the attack. JPMorgan has previously warned prices could spike to $130 a barrel in the “severe outcome” of a blockade to flows via the Strait of Hormuz or a broader conflagration in the Middle East.

“It comes really at an unfortunate time for the global economy given the already heightened uncertainty and chaotic nature we are dealing with coming out of the US protectionist stance,” Katrina Ell, Moody’s Analytics head of Asia Pacific economics, said on Bloomberg Television.

For the US, a substantial and sustained increase in oil prices would add to the inflationary impulse from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Bloomberg Economics analysts Jennifer Welch, Adam Farrar and economist Tom Orlik wrote in a note.

“Coming hard on the heels of the post-pandemic surge in inflation, and with concern that inflation expectations are not firmly anchored, that would be difficult for Fed Chair Jerome Powell &amp; Co. to look through,” they said.

In a separate note, Orlik and Chief US Economist Anna Wong ran the numbers on what a surge in the price of oil would mean for the US economy. They found a jump in the price of Brent to $100 a barrel would result in a 17% increase in all grades of gasoline prices in the US, corresponding to a rise to $4.2 a gallon from $3.25 a gallon. They estimate that would add 0.6 percentage point to headline CPI, boosting the year-over-year change to the CPI to 3.2% in June.

The Federal Reserve meets next week to set interest rates, as do monetary authorities in the UK, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan.

Central banks will likely acknowledge the growing uncertainties but will be inclined to look through the impact of higher oil prices from today’s attack, said Diana Mousina, Sydney-based deputy chief economist at AMP Ltd.

“I don’t think that any oil price dislocation is going to change the trajectory for interest rates,” she said. “It’s just another layer of volatility in the market.”</p>

The European Commission announced Thursday that the so-called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, a boring technocratic name if there ever was one, will be delayed one year until 2027. It would place stricter rules on the region’s investment-bank trading desks at a time when the US seems increasingly less inclined to impose similar regulations of its own.

The new rules are part of the Basel III international banking reforms that were introduced in 2017 and designed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Basel III is meant to create global standards for the way banks measure risk and enhance their ability to withstand shocks (a.k.a. prevent another systemic implosion worthy of an Oscar-winning Matt Damon-narrated documentary). Specifically, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book will tighten how banks measure and hold reserves against their capital markets activities, zeroing in on investment banking.

Investment banking, of course, is on an earnings tear on both sides of the Atlantic, with trading desks cashing in on volatile equities even as US tariff policy has curbed M&amp;A activity. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reported record revenue from their equity traders in the first quarter, while investment banking fees rose 12% at JPMorgan and 8% at Morgan Stanley. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, reported its highest quarterly pre-tax profit in 14 years in the first quarter, with its trading unit netting record revenues. Income at France’s largest bank, BNP Paribas, slipped in its latest quarter, but the equities desk was a bright spot with a record result. Were the EU to implement the new rules now, however, the region’s investment banks could look across the Atlantic and see a US administration less inclined to follow suit:

Last year, the Federal Reserve softened its proposed Basel III rules after intense lobbying from the banking industry. That was even before the second Trump administration, which promised a deregulation-focused agenda, came into power. Last month, the Financial Times reported that US officials plan to roll back bank capital requirements in the next few months.

In January, as Trump entered office, the UK put its own new capital rules on hold until 2027, with the Bank of England stating that it wanted to see what the US does first, in the interest of its own “competitiveness and growth considerations.” The European Commission made a similar case Thursday, noting that “concerns regarding the international level playing field and the impact on EU banks remain high.”</p>

NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire

The financial technology firm’s shares opened trading Thursday at $43 after selling for $27 in the IPO, rising as much as 66%. The shares closed at $37.11 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of $13.5 billion.

Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, Chime has a fully diluted value of about $15.8 billion based on its filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That fully diluted value is a sharp drop from Chime’s $25 billion valuation in a 2021 funding round at the peak of the tech boom.

“We don’t focus on short-term fluctuation of the stock — even if it goes up today, I’m sure there’s going to be other days that won’t be as great,” Chime Chief Executive Officer Chris Britt said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We remain focused on the long term.”

There’s been a modest rebound in US IPOs in the wake of President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement that spurred several companies to hit the pause button on their listing plans.

The average first-day jump for new offerings has been about 25% this year for US IPOs that raised at least $100 million — the most since 2020. In all, almost $27 billion has been raised in 156 IPOs on New York exchanges since Jan. 1, compared with $19 billion in 92 listings at this point last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

At least two other significant IPOs are set to price next week before what is shaping up to be a summer lull in the US. Caris Life Sciences Inc. is seeking to raise as much as $423.5 million, while Slide Insurance Holdings Inc. is planning an offering of up to $340 million.

Chime’s investors include affiliates of DST Global, Crosslink Capital, Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, General Atlantic, Menlo Ventures, Cathay Innovation and Iconiq, the filings show. After the IPO, Chime co-founders Britt and Ryan King will continue to hold more than 70% of shareholder voting power in aggregate.

Shawn Carolan, a Menlo Ventures partner and Chime board member, said he’s relieved there was a reprieve in the markets following the tariff-induced volatility in April.</p>

BAC expects IB fees to decline more than 20% year over year in the second quarter as tariff-related headwinds continue to hamper deal-making sentiments. In the first quarter, IB fees of $1.52 billion million declined 3% as the plunge in equity underwriting income was more than offset by higher advisory revenues and debt underwriting income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB fees is pegged at $1.53 billion for the ongoing quarter.

Meanwhile, driven by heightened market volatility and a rise in client activity, Bank of America projects trading revenues to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit range in the quarter. This will mark the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in sales and trading revenues for the company. Last quarter, BAC’s sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) of $5.65 billion represented the highest number in a decade. The consensus estimate for sales and trading is pegged at $5.11 billion for second-quarter 2025, suggesting year-over-year growth of 9%. 

With sales and trading accounting for about 43% of Bank of America’s fee income, ongoing momentum in this area should help offset pressure elsewhere. As such, the consensus estimate for non-interest income is $11.87 billion, implying a rise of 2% from the prior-year quarter.

Like Bank of America, JPMorgan JPM anticipates markets revenues to grow in the mid-to-high single-digits range on a year-over-year basis for the second quarter. This is likely to be driven by a significant rise in market volatility and higher client activity. Additionally, JPMorgan’s IB fees are expected to be down in the mid-teens range.

Citigroup C, on the other hand, projects second-quarter IB fees to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis as deal-making activities rebounded and stock markets recovered from the ambiguity over the final tariff decision. Moreover, like BAC and JPMorgan, Citigroup’s trading business is showing signs of strength. Citigroup projects markets revenues to grow in the mid-to-high single-digits range.

Shares of Bank of America have risen 12.8% in the past three months. In the same time frame, JPMorgan soared 19.1%, and Citigroup was up 16.6%.</p>

JPMorgan Chase seeks to dismiss part of a lawsuit it’s facing from Wells Fargo on the grounds that it was actually the victim in an underlying criminal conspiracy.

Wells Fargo sued JPMorgan in March, accusing the country’s biggest bank of failing to conduct due diligence on a $481 million commercial real estate loan it originated for its customer, Chetrit Group, in 2019. The loan was later sold to a JPMorgan affiliate and deposited into a commercial mortgage-backed securities trust, of which Wells was trustee.

But an executive of ROCO Real Estate, which was the seller of the 43 properties the loan intended to buy, pleaded guilty in 2023 to a conspiracy to falsify records that inflated financial figures in the deal.

Specifically, ROCO CEO Tyler Ross pleaded guilty to falsifying trailing 12-month operating statements, which provides a picture of a property’s financial performance over the preceding 12 months, “purportedly inflat[ing] the [net operating income] on those properties by approximately $10 million,” according to JPMorgan.

“Through this lawsuit, [Wells] seeks to hold JPMorgan liable for ROCO’s criminal conduct, even though JPMorgan was the victim of that crime, and knew nothing of ROCO’s fraudulent scheme at the time JPMorgan originated the Mortgage Loan,” JPMorgan wrote.

While most claims asserted in Wells’ complaint are against Chetrit and not JPMorgan, one count alleges that JPMorgan breached its representations and warranties under the Mortgage Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement and is therefore obligated to repurchase the $481 million loan because JPMorgan had “actual knowledge” of an “Event of Default” under the loan agreement.

JPMorgan’s knowledge, Wells alleged, was of the fraudulent nature of ROCO’s trailing 12-month operating statements.

“Plaintiff asserts that, because JPMorgan was allegedly aware of some inaccuracies in ROCO’s financials, JPMorgan must have also been aware that ROCO was engaged in a broad fraudulent scheme. But Plaintiff does not plead any facts to support that inference,” JPMorgan wrote, adding that the district judge in Ross’ criminal case concluded that JPMorgan’s knowledge of some inaccuracies in ROCO’s financials does not prove that it knew the extent of the fraud in the T12s.

Additionally, Wells’ claim for breach of the mortgage loan purchase agreement “fails as a matter of law because the Complaint does not plead any facts to show that the breach was ‘material.’ … Plaintiff does not plead any facts to explain how the falsified T12s impacted either the price paid for the Mortgage Loan or the risk of loss on that loan. Absent those crucial factual allegations, Plaintiff fails to plead materiality, and Count 1 should be dismissed,” JPMorgan wrote.</p>

The fund is sponsored by J.P. Morgan. It has amassed assets over $1.87 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.

Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don&#39;t, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.

Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.

Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF&#39;s expense ratio.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.

It is important to delve into an ETF&#39;s holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 21% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Jpmorgan Us Govt Mmkt Fun accounts for about 1.45% of total assets, followed by Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) and Expand Energy Corp (EXE).

The top 10 holdings account for about 6.57% of total assets under management.

BBMC seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR US MID CAP TGT MK EXP EXT ID before fees and expenses. The Morningstar US Mid Cap Target Market Exposure Extended Index is a free-float adjusted market-cap weighted index which consists of equity securities traded in the United States.

The ETF has lost about -0.40% so far this year and was up about 11.01% in the last one year (as of 06/12/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $79.01 and $105.01.

The ETF has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 20.86% for the trailing three-year period. With about 578 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p>

Private equity firms often offer positions up to two years before the start date, leading many recent graduates to pursue these lucrative roles before or during their time as investment banking analysts at firms like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).

Now, JPMorgan is warning new US analysts that accepting a future job offer within 18 months of starting at the bank could result in termination. This policy aims to prevent any &#34;potential conflicts of interest&#34; and preserve client trust. The memo also notes that analysts could be fired for missing onboarding or summer training sessions.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon called out the issue of losing talent to private equity last year, labeling it &#34;unethical.&#34; He explained that job hopping to private equity puts the bank in a difficult spot since analysts might already be committed elsewhere while handling sensitive information at JPMorgan.

While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?

The advance on Wednesday pushed yields lower across maturities, beginning during US morning after consumer price index data showed underlying inflation rose in May by less than forecast for the fourth straight month. The broad market, led by long-dated yields declined further after the monthly auction of 10-year notes showed investors were willing to accept a lower-than-anticipated interest rate.

Short-dated yields, more sensitive to changes in the Fed’s policy rate, were lower by seven basis points late in New York and near session lows reached mid-afternoon. Ten- to 30-year yields fell to new lows after the auction and remained lower by five and two basis points. A higher-stakes 30-year bond auction Thursday concludes this week’s Treasury supply cycle.

The 10-year results show “strong end-user demand, especially considering the modest rally heading in,” said Zachary Griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at CreditSights. “At this point it seems like concerns about demand are focused on the very long end of the curve,” and the 10-year result “does not signal the all-clear for the 30-year tomorrow.”

The $39 billion auction was awarded at 4.421%, less than a basis point lower than its yield in pre-auction trading at 1 p.m. New York time, the bidding deadline. Bidder-participation metrics were strong, with non-dealers taking more than 90% of the offering.

Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recent bond auctions have gone well, with rising end-user demand. He also highlighted that US 10-year yields have declined this year.

Thirty-year yields remain about 10 basis points higher than where they began the year ahead of Thursday’s $22 billion auction, at around 4.91%. The prospect of wider US government budget deficits has driven the increase since late April.

Following the CPI report, traders priced in 47 basis points of Fed easing by the end of the year, compared to about 42 basis points at Tuesday’s close. While the Fed’s next move is fully priced in for October, traders increased expectations for a cut in September to around odds of 75%.</p>

NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where?

The Denver-based defense contractor’s stock closed at $56.48 each on Wednesday, versus the IPO price of $31 apiece. The company sold more than 12.3 million shares, after having marketed 11 million shares for $26 to $29.

The trading gives Voyager Technologies a market value of $3.2 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings.

Janus Henderson Investors and Wellington Management have indicated an interest in buying a total of $60 million of shares in aggregate, the filings show.

Founded in 2019 and recently rebranded from Voyager Space, Voyager Technologies serves both government and commercial clients across sectors including national security, advanced technology and space infrastructure, according to the filings.

Space Station Replacement

Voyager has a $217.5 million development grant with NASA to design Starlab, the commercial space station planned to replace the International Space Station, which is set to be decommissioned in 2030. Voyager plans to operate Starlab through a joint venture with equity partners including Airbus SE, Mitsubishi Corp., MDA Space Ltd. and Palantir Technologies Inc.

The recent hostilities between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk jolted the share prices of companies in the sector on the prospect that SpaceX’s dominant position had become vulnerable, though Musk later expressed regret over the rift.

In an interview on Bloomberg TV Wednesday, Voyager Chief Executive Officer Dylan Taylor credited SpaceX as a crucial player in the industry, and said that there are other firms that are also doing great things. The space sector is unique in that companies are looking to collaborate and cooperate, he said.

“Really, everyone is rooting for everyone else,” Taylor said. “I mean that sincerely, because it’s important we get replacements up there prior to the International Space Station being decommissioned.”

Another firm with links to both Voyager and the government is Palantir. A joint venture partner on the Starlab project, it’s also a Voyager share holder, the filing shows. Voyager issued 228,365 shares to the data analytics firm in April last year as payment for for services including developing a prototype to schedule payloads to the ISS.</p>

NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where?

In a letter sent to candidates on Wednesday, Apollo explained its decision by saying it believes graduates should take time early in their careers and deepen their understanding of business. Apollo’s Chief Executive Officer Marc Rowan said he agreed with recent criticisms that the process for hiring young recruits had started too early.

“Hiring decisions at Apollo are among the most significant to our business,” David Sambur, co-head of private equity and Nicole Bonsignore, head of human capital, wrote in the letter seen by Bloomberg. “With that in mind, we will not formally interview and extend offers this year for the class of 2027.”

Tensions over private equity firms recruiting junior investment bankers have simmered for more than a decade. Banks have sought to strike a balance between taking steps to avoid losing talented young employees while not angering those workers or the buyout firms that are often among their biggest clients.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon last year said in a talk at Georgetown University that he didn’t like the practice of junior bankers agreeing to their second job at a private equity firm before starting their first role at a bank.

“It puts us in a bad position, and it puts us in a conflicted position,” Dimon said then. “You are already working for somewhere else, and you’re dealing with highly confidential information from JPMorgan, and I just don’t like it.”

JPMorgan this month told incoming graduates that they’ll be fired if they accept future job offers at other firms either before starting at the bank or within their first 18 months, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg.

“When someone says something that is just plainly true, I feel compelled to agree with it,” Rowan said in an emailed statement. “Bank CEOs, along with others, have said what many of us have been thinking: Recruiting has crept earlier and earlier every year, and asking students to make career decisions before they truly understand their options doesn’t serve them or our industry.”</p>

“We&#39;re working with the industry, working individually. We have this pretty well understood … but the problem before was it wasn&#39;t clear we were allowed to do it under the banking regulations, and there was a lot of mystery about that,” Moynihan said at a Morgan Stanley conference in New York.

Unlike bitcoin and other digital assets, stablecoin prices aren&#39;t supposed to fluctuate. Instead, they are pegged to assets such as the US dollar and are seen more widely as a means of payment.

As far back as February, Moynihan has said that his bank would plan to launch a stablecoin pending crypto legislation. What has not been highlighted before is that his bank will wait for both pieces of legislation to pass before moving forward.

“If they get the Genius Act or the stable act or anything like that passed,—and then they get the markets infrastructure enablement piece — that will allow us to figure out whether there&#39;s really a business proposition” in stablecoins, Moynihan added.

Meanwhile, Bank of America&#39;s investment banking is expected to decline by more than 20% in the second quarter compared to the year ago period, Moynihan said. Trading revenue is poised for a &#34;mid-to-high single digit&#34; increase for the same period.

In recent days, Wall Street has been embracing the potential that crypto stablecoins may bring to digital payments and wider finance.

Legislation setting rules for how bank holding companies and other firms can issue stablecoins, known as the Genius Act, has been reintroduced in the Senate this week. Its final passage is expected as early as next week, according to a Senate aide.

Both Democratic and Republican Senators have called for at least seven notable amendments to the bill, including one preventing the president and his family from profiting via a stablecoin venture while in office. Another, proposed by Senator John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), would add language prohibiting interest paid to stablecoin customers as a way to protect the competitive standing of the nation’s community banks.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has prevented the Senate from voting on those amendments, according to the aide.

The other larger and more recently introduced piece of crypto legislation, known as the Clarity Act, sets rules for the overall market regulation of digital assets and hasn’t yet made it to the House floor.

As part of a broader executive order and campaign promise to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet,” President Trump has previously indicated a desire for both pieces of legislation to be passed quickly.</p>

Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has dared Wall Street giants such as JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to compete in the Bitcoin economy. He said:

The preferred stocks that Strategy offers — STRK, STRF, and STRD are tied to Bitcoin&#39;s measured performance and a fraction of its volatility, allowing the company to issue what Saylor called &#34;the most liquid preferred stocks in the world with the highest performance.&#34; The advantage Strategy holds is that it is a 100% Bitcoin company, he underlined.

Saylor added that he deemed it impossible for a company to issue Bitcoin-backed convertible or fixed preferred stocks unless it was willing to turn its entire balance sheet Bitcoin-based. He added:

The Bitcoin bill said he would love to see these established institutions purchase the cryptocurrency. But when they will purchase it, they&#39;ll be paying $1 million per Bitcoin for the acquisition, he warned:

Saylor made these remarks in an interview with Bloomberg Crypto on 10 June. He added that Bitcoin&#39;s epic rally will be good for the entire crypto economy, including everyone holding any Bitcoin-backed equity or credit based instruments.

The Strategy chairman also addressed JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett characterizing Bitcoin as &#34;worthless&#34; and “rat poison squared” respectively. The Bitcoin advocate argued that people even called electricity and airplanes worthless in the beginning because they didn&#39;t understand the new technologies.

Saylor&#39;s Strategy began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 and is the world&#39;s largest corporate Bitcoin holder today.

As per Kraken, Bitcoin was trading at $109,698.76 at press time.

JPM was added due to strong organic growth while restructuring-driven upside was attributed for Citigroup’s inclusion.

JP Morgan remains Wells Fargo’s top pick in large-cap U.S. banks following its investor day, where the CEO emphasized that value creation will continue to be driven by “organic growth and good returns.”

The firm noted JPM has exceeded its 17% ROTCE target in six of the last seven years and expects to continue doing so through 2027.

JP Morgan gained deposit share in 30 of 31 top U.S. metro areas over the past five years. Its branch expansion, over 900 new locations, outpaces peers and underpins further earnings upside.

The bank’s $57 billion in current excess capital, estimated to rise to $200 billion over three years, also gives it significant financial flexibility.

The CEO highlighted JPMorgan’s technology investments, especially in AI, which the bank likened to being the “Nvidia of Banking.”

Wells Fargo believes this could help JPM sustain operational efficiency and distribution advantage over time.

Separately, Wells Fargo reiterated Citigroup as a top pick, calling its ongoing restructuring a “transformation dividend.”

The firm estimates Citi is three-quarters through its overhaul but has only realized a quarter of the potential financial benefits.

Citigroup expects expense reductions to continue through 2025 and 2026, with ROTCE reaching 10–11% in 2026, improving further beyond that.

Recent presentations pointed to market share gains in investment banking and an expanding global payments business as global trade patterns shift.

“Citi … transitions to a more advanced stage of its multi-year restructuring and, from value destruction to value creation in 2026,” Wells Fargo said, while also noting upside potential in trading and investment banking in the near term.

After stablecoin issuer Circle exploded 300% higher in its IPO, plenty of big players on Wall Street are taking a second look at their crypto strategies. That could very well trigger a second wave of hyper crypto institutionalization that has been building all year.

This week, Bernstein is pointing out that could spell a “critical inflection point” for Ethereum as a premium could once again return to onchain use cases. And right now, there is no greater use case being discussed than stablecoins. The question is: Is the juice worth the squeeze?

But before we get into why Circle’s IPO is forcing a recalibration on Wall Street, let’s first start with some facts:

Circle priced shares at $31 in its IPO on Thursday

Circle shares opened for trading at $69 on Thursday

Circle shares opened for trading today at $132.72

So either someone got this one very wrong, or a large chunk of the market woke up to being severely underexposed to crypto and is now trying to figure out the right way to catch up. I would posit that the best way to play catch up is not through CRCL for a number of reasons.

But don’t take my word for it — take a look at the analysis from Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell — who says that even in a bull case, Circle shares should only trade at $119 if all goes great next year.

The thing is, yes, everyone expects the stablecoin market to continue to grow. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Circle’s business is going to justify the 4x it just pulled off in its IPO. For one thing, as interest rates come down, Circle will be able to make less off of the assets it holds in custody to back its USDC stablecoin. As Farrell estimates, “every 25 bps cut in the reserve rate reduces 2026 EBITDA estimates by roughly $100 million dollars, holding all else equal.&#34;</p>

Shares of Mastercard shed as much as 6.2% Friday, while Visa lost more than 7.1% — the worst one-day drop in about two months for both stocks. Shares of other payment companies such as American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. also slipped in intraday trading.

The sector is being weighed down by a Wall Street Journal report citing unidentified people that Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among companies that have recently discussed issuing their own stablecoins in the US. In addition to large merchants, other multinational giants like airline operators and Expedia Group, Inc. have also considered issuing their own crypto tokens to bypass credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are usually pegged to a currency like the US dollar so the tokens can be used for payments.

Though the news erased more than $60 billion in market value from Visa and Mastercard combined, analysts said now is a good time to snap up the stocks at a discount.

“We encourage investors to accumulate shares of Visa and Mastercard on weakness,” Andrew Jeffrey of William Blair wrote in a note, reiterating outperform ratings on both companies.

Jeffrey said stablecoins are still not very suitable for business-to-consumer commerce, “even as merchants view them as a potential means of lowering card acceptance costs.”

Consumers are accustomed to using credit and debit cards, habits that won’t soon change, he said, adding that a lack of stablecoin standards can also limit its use. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Diksha Gera said that Friday’s share declines reflect fears that stablecoins could erode volume share and margin, but it’s a premature worry.

“Visa and Mastercard have proactively integrated stablecoin capabilities, while lingering trust and regulatory hurdles, along with a prolonged adoption curve by consumers, might impede widespread adoption,” Gera wrote in a note.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Rufus Hone agrees that broad-based stablecoin adoption within consumer payments is an unlikely outcome, but said even if the tokens are adopted, Visa and Mastercard are poised to benefit.</p>

V focuses on sharpening its edge in the digital payments space through robust and growing fintech partnerships, acquisitions and platform building. It is redefining its role from a card network to a vital technology partner in the ever-changing payments landscape. The company saw impressive growth in payment volume during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting from its partnerships with fintech companies and the increase in consumer spending on its app-based platforms.

In fiscal 2023, Visa’s payment volume rose 9% year over year on a constant-dollar basis, which grew 8% year over year in fiscal 2024, followed by an 8% increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. In the same quarter, processed transactions grew 9% year over year. Our model suggests a 9.9% year-over-year increase in processed transactions in fiscal 2025.

Visa extended its partnership with TabaPay, which is serving over 6,500 fintechs and businesses. With Visa Direct, the company introduced push-to-account and wallet features alongside the existing push-to-card option. It also launched a new program, Visa Commercial Integrated Partners, designed to improve connectivity between fintechs and Visa Commercial products.

Visa’s proactive strategies reflect its active move to shape the new era of payments. As the demand for digital payment rises globally, the company’s position as a flexible infrastructure partner might be its valuable long-term advantage.

Some of V’s competitors in the fintech payments space are Mastercard Incorporated MA and PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL.

Mastercard reported a 15% Y/Y increase in cross-border volumes in the first quarter of 2025. In the same quarter, its payment network net revenues grew 13% year over year. Mastercard projects adjusted net revenues to witness low-teens growth in 2025.

PayPal Holdings’ total payment volume increased 3% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company’s payment transactions decreased 7% year over year in the same quarter. PayPal Holdings anticipates the transaction margin to be in the range of $15.2-$15.4 billion in 2025.

Shares of Visa have jumped 12.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the 8.5% growth of the industry.

From a valuation standpoint, V trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.1, above the industry average of 23.7. V carries a Value Score of D.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa’s fiscal 2025 earnings implies a 12.9% jump from the year-ago period. It witnessed 11 upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days against one downward movement.</p>

The report said the two companies, along with others such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group and major airlines, have discussed launching stablecoins in the U.S., citing people familiar with the matter.

Such a move could shift billions of dollars in payment volume away from banks and card networks, the Journal said, potentially allowing large merchants to reduce transaction fees and tighten control over payment infrastructure.

Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a fixed value against government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar, and are typically backed by cash or short-term Treasurys.

The retailers’ final decisions would hinge on progress of the Genius Act, a bill that aims to establish regulatory oversight for stablecoins.

The legislation recently advanced past a procedural vote but still requires passage by both chambers of Congress.

Other payment processors also suffered, with Capital One (NYSE:COF) down 3%, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) falling 2.6%, and Block dropping 2.4%.

According to the report, retail giants including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have recently explored issuing their own stablecoins in the U.S., a move that could potentially save them billions in transaction fees by shifting payment processing outside the traditional financial system. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group and several major airlines have reportedly engaged in similar discussions.

Stablecoins, which maintain a one-to-one exchange ratio with government currencies and are backed by cash reserves or cash-like assets such as Treasury securities, are currently primarily used for cryptocurrency transactions. However, their potential application in everyday retail transactions poses a significant threat to established payment networks.

The retailers’ final decisions reportedly hinge on the Genius Act, pending legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. While the bill has cleared a procedural hurdle, it still requires approval from both the Senate and House.

The potential entry of major retailers into the payment processing space with their own digital currencies could significantly disrupt the business model of traditional payment networks, which generate substantial revenue from transaction fees charged to merchants.

V recently announced an extensive enhancement of its Visa Infinite card benefits in 18 markets across the Asia Pacific region. The refreshed benefits focus strongly on travel experiences. Visa Infinite cardholders will now enjoy up to 30% discounts on hotel bookings made through Agoda, as well as 20% savings on reservations with IHG and Accor hotel groups.

Additionally, cardholders can select from more than 1,000 curated properties in the Visa Luxury Hotel Collection. These stays come with a suite of complimentary benefits. Cardholders will also receive Titanium tier membership with GHA Discovery hotels, offering a wide array of choices from Agoda homestays to opulent six-star hotels.

Travel perks continue at seven key airports in the region— Hong Kong International Airport, Incheon International Airport, Melbourne International Airport, Perth International Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, Survanabhumi International Airport and Sydney International Airport—where cardholders can avail up to 20% off at selected food and beverage outlets.

The lifestyle upgrades are equally compelling. Visa Infinite cardholders will receive 10% off on duty-free shopping at Lotte Duty Free outlets. At Harrods, they will be granted complimentary Gold tier membership, which includes a 10% discount on dining. Visa’s partnership with ION Orchard, one of Singapore’s premier retail destinations, introduces exclusive retail promotions through the ‘Shop and Get’ program. This initiative allows cardholders to earn points and e-vouchers.

For international travelers, Visa Infinite now offers complimentary access to Global Blue VIP Lounges situated in prominent European cities such as Paris, Milan, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Marbella. Moreover, cardholders benefit from free access to Global Blue Airport Fast Lanes.

The recent updates cater to the aspirations of affluent consumers who increasingly value unique experiences and personal enrichment. Also, Visa’s refreshed card benefits seem to be time opportune in Asia Pacific as the region emerges as a global center for wealth generation and is projected to account for 47.5% of all new high-net-worth individuals between 2025 and 2028.

For transactions made using Visa-branded cards processed on its network, the company offers services such as authorization, clearing and settlement. In the course of delivering these services, V generates service, data processing, international transaction and other related revenues.

Therefore, moves similar to the latest one are expected to attract new customers and retain existing ones to use the Visa Infinite card by enriching them with lucrative features and benefits. Visa Infinite continues to define the standard for premium payment solutions, offering a seamless and secure way to pay worldwide, whether for booking luxury travel, shopping abroad or purchasing concert tickets.</p>

NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where?

Senate leaders are expected to bat away efforts to attach language pushed by retailers and their allies in the Senate to mandate competition to Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. in credit card processing, as well as a Democratic push to ban Trump from profiting off his crypto ventures.

The 68-30 procedural vote on Wednesday clears a key procedural obstacle. It came a day after the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees advanced broader crypto legislation, with Republicans beating back amendments targeting Trump’s crypto profits.

Both measures are top priorities for the digital assets industry. Crypto titans flooded money into last year’s election with the best-funded alliance of corporate political action committees in US history — Fairshake PAC and two affiliated entities.

Industry backers are hoping the stablecoin legislation — which aims to set rules for crypto tokens pegged to value of the US dollar or another traditional traditional currency — will help turn stablecoins into a mainstream form of payment.

Some Republicans in the House have talked up the idea of packaging the broader bill governing the regulation of digital assets with the stablecoin measure, but that could delay getting the stablecoin bill to the president’s desk.

Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott has told Bloomberg he expects to hold a hearing on a broad crypto regulation bill in July but does not anticipate passing it in the Senate until the fall.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune on the Senate floor Wednesday set a goal of passing the stablecoin bill within days and said he hoped the House would quickly send it to Trump’s desk.

Backers, including the president and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have touted dollar-pegged stablecoins for their potential to increase demand for dollars and U.S. debt. Under the legislation, stablecoin issuers would have to hold dollar-for-dollar reserves in assets like short-term government debt or similar products supervised by federal or state regulators.

Retailers have lobbied for the bill in hopes that stablecoins will give them cheaper and faster transactions than existing payment systems including credit cards. They have been pushing to attach the credit card measure, which would mandate large banks include a competitor to Visa and Mastercard networks for processing credit card transactions.</p>

AI is about to change healthcare. These 22 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there&#39;s still time to get in early.

Visa&#39;s recent partnership with Worldpay and the launch of the Tap to Pay Visa Gift Card reflects its ongoing efforts to bolster online transaction security and foster innovation in payment solutions. These initiatives could positively influence Visa&#39;s long-term growth narrative by enhancing user engagement, expanding transaction volumes, and ultimately supporting revenue growth. Additionally, Visa&#39;s focus on security measures could further entrench its market position, crucial for its strategic geographical expansions.

Over the last five years, Visa&#39;s total return, including share price and dividends, achieved a substantial 99.15% increase, showcasing strong performance. Comparatively, over the past year, Visa&#39;s return outpaced the US Diversified Financial industry, recording gains above the industry&#39;s 23.3% return. This indicates robust market positioning and a favorable reception among investors.

Visa’s current and forecasted financial performance reveals a promising trajectory, with revenue and earnings anticipated to grow as the company capitalizes on stablecoin innovations and value-added services. However, the analyst consensus price target of US$374.25 suggests only a modest increase from the current share price of US$347.7, indicating that Visa&#39;s market valuation aligns closely with analysts&#39; expectations of future performance. Consequently, investors should consider both the potential for future growth and existing valuation when assessing Visa&#39;s investment prospects.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 11, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With exactly one year to go until the FIFA World Cup 26™ kicks off across Canada, Mexico and the United States, Visa (NYSE: V) — a global leader in digital payments and long-standing supporter of world football — today announced that Lamine Yamal, one of the game’s brightest rising stars, will serve as a global ambassador for the tournament.

To celebrate the milestone and build momentum toward the largest FIFA World Cup™ in history, Visa will unlock exclusive fan experiences for cardholders — including meet-and-greet opportunities with Lamine Yamal in Barcelona and signed merchandise leading into FIFA World Cup 26™.

&#34;As we look ahead to FIFA World Cup 26™, we’re aligning with like-minded athletes and brands who share our vision for using football to uplift and unite,&#34; said Andrea Fairchild, SVP, Global Sponsorship Strategy, Visa. &#34;In Lamine’s case, it’s about honoring the sport’s legacy and giving back to the fans who power it.&#34;

Yamal is captivating the football world with record-setting performances, and his skill, speed and vision on the field have made him a breakout global star — and a symbol of where the game is heading. As its global ambassador, Lamine Yamal stated, &#34;Football is more than a game, it’s joy and a way to connect with people around the world. I’m proud to partner with Visa to share that passion and inspire people through sport.&#34;

As an Official Payment Technology Partner of FIFA, Visa has used the power of football to drive inclusion and access around the world — from grassroots programs to global stages. Through innovative fan experiences, athlete partnerships and exclusive cardholder benefits, Visa continues to redefine what’s possible for fans, players, and the future of the game.

As part of its commitment to uplifting communities through the power of sport, Visa has deepened its partnership with Street Soccer USA (SSUSA) to create six community-driven soccer parks in San Francisco, Denver, Kansas City, New York City, Nashville and Atlanta. More than just fields, these parks are designed to uplift and build stronger and more connected communities — where individuals can connect, grow, and thrive.

Harnessing the unifying power of soccer, the companies will provide open park space in six cities to bring people together, foster youth development, and strengthen community ties through sport and purpose-driven programming.

&#34;This movement is about scale, sustainability, and impact,&#34; said Lawrence Cann, Co-Founder and President of Street Soccer USA. &#34;Alongside our partners, we are making a significant pass toward building a national network of parks that deliver real value—on and off the field. These are spaces where young people can grow, communities can connect, and every victory, big or small, can lead to meaningful change.&#34;

Visa Street Soccer Parks, the first of which opened today in San Francisco, are intentionally designed to be vibrant centers for community engagement, offering more than just a space for soccer. Each park will feature two professional-grade Bank of America fields, providing facilities with lighting for evening activities, digital scoreboards, learning centers and seating areas for spectators and special events.

Park locations and projected opening:

San Francisco – Opened June 2025

Denver – August 2025

Kansas City – September 2025

New York City – October 2025

Nashville – November 2025

Atlanta – Winter 2025

As momentum builds ahead of one of the biggest landmark years for soccer in U.S. history, these parks will provide a local platform for community connection, growth, and opportunity – into 2026 and beyond.

&#34;Through this partnership, we&#39;re creating more than soccer parks—we&#39;re building platforms for progress,&#34; said Kim Lawrence, President, North America, Visa. &#34;Each park represents a step toward stronger, more connected communities. By combining the power of sports with access to education and opportunity, we&#39;re helping individuals and families move forward—one goal, one lesson, and one connection at a time.&#34;

&#34;Sports bring communities together, and over the next few years, the entire world will come together for soccer in North America,&#34; said David Tyrie, President, Marketing, Digital and Specialized Consumer Client Solutions at Bank of America. &#34;These fields will provide high-quality spaces where the lessons of soccer – teamwork, goal-setting, preparation and determination – come to life for the next generation.&#34;</p>

The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually make its stock &#39;trending&#39; and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company&#39;s earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock&#39;s fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $11.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.76 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock&#39;s price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">The cryptocurrency rally, which had slowed at the end of May, has regained momentum and is on track to reach a new high as investor confidence continues to bolster the market. Bitcoin (BTC), which reached a record high in May, gave up some of the gains but has since bounced back and is trading above the $110,000 mark.

The pullback seen in late May was largely due to profit-taking by the big whales, which have been selling off Bitcoin as tariff tensions continued to worry them. However, positive economic data, such as easing inflation, has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve might begin cutting interest rates soon, which is likely to benefit the crypto market.

In this environment, investing in crypto-related stocks could be a strategic move. Companies like PayPal Holdings PYPL, Visa Inc. V, and CME Group Inc. CME stand out for their strong growth potential heading into 2025. All three have seen upward revisions in earnings estimates over the past three months.

Bitcoin hit a record high of $111,886.41 on May 22. However, the cryptocurrency gave up some of its gains in the final week of May. The decline can be attributed to profit-taking. However, Bitcoin has still managed to stay above the $100,000 mark for more than 30 days at a stretch.

The rally regained momentum over the weekend, and on Monday, Bitcoin price surged more than 4% and was hovering around 110,500. The continued rally in Bitcoin is being driven by a mix of favorable developments, including improving U.S.-China trade relations, optimism over upcoming crypto regulations and increasing institutional investment.

Investor sentiment has further improved after President Donald Trump announced a temporary pause on new tariffs, and the United States and China agreed to a 90-day halt on imposing fresh duties. Talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled, alongside negotiations with other global trading partners.

Meanwhile, regulatory progress in the crypto space is boosting confidence. The GENIUS Act — a legislative proposal aimed at regulating stablecoins — has made progress in the Senate. Trump and his crypto/AI advisor, David Sacks, have continued voicing strong support for pro-crypto policies, signaling a more favorable future for the digital asset industry.

PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Through PYPL, cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal’s mobile wallet platform, Venmo, allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities.</p>

Two brand-name businesses with sustainable moats have the tools to eventually join Wall Street&#39;s exclusive trillion-dollar club.

10 stocks we like better than Visa ›

Over the last century, no asset class has come remotely close to matching the annual return of stocks. Spanning multidecade periods, it&#39;s commonplace to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite pushing to all-time highs.

But something that&#39;s been exceptionally rare on Wall Street is seeing a publicly traded company hit a nominal market cap of $1 trillion. Only 11 public companies, 10 of which trade in the U.S., have ever achieved this psychologically important valuation:

Microsoft

Nvidia

Apple

Amazon

Alphabet

Meta Platforms

Broadcom

Berkshire Hathaway

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

Tesla

Saudi Aramco (not traded in the U.S.)

The trillion-dollar question is: Which companies are next to join this exclusive and elite club?

While game-changing technology stocks have been the correct answer in recent years, and quite a few investors might side with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven colossus Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) as the logical choice, two non-tech stocks appear ideally positioned to join this group of 11 elite businesses sooner than later.

Since the end of 2022, shares of Palantir have returned nearly 1,900%, which has lifted the company&#39;s market cap to north of $300 billion. In other words, Palantir went from being a tech stock of fringe importance to being one of the foundational companies within the sector.

Palantir&#39;s claim to fame is its AI- and machine learning-powered Gotham and Foundry platforms. The former assists federal governments with data collection and analysis, as well as aids with military mission planning and execution. Meanwhile, Foundry is a subscription-based service for businesses that helps them make sense of their data and streamline their operations. Neither of Palantir&#39;s operating segments has large-scale direct competitors, which is a fancy way of saying it has a sustainable moat.

It also doesn&#39;t hurt having the U.S. government as a top client. The multiyear contracts Gotham has landed with the U.S. government have decisively pushed the company into the recurring profit column and made its cash flow quite predictable.</p>

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gorilla Technology this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here, as you see below.

Earnings ESP: Gorilla Technology has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: GRRR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Gorilla Technology’s revenues are expected to have gained on the back of expanding operations across the USA, MENA, Southeast &amp; East Asia, South America and the UK in the first quarter.

Strong execution on key contracts, new business growth and high client retention rates are likely to have resulted from sustained demand for GRRR’s AI-driven security and intelligence solutions, which in turn, is likely to have driven its top line.

In the to-be-reported quarter, the gross margin is expected to have witnessed continued growth, thanks to its prudent cost-cutting initiatives, high-value solutions and long-term scalability.

Expense management efforts are also likely to have aided the net income of the company. A decrease in debt level is expected to have reduced the interest expenses of Gorilla Technology in the first quarter.

Of the other Business Services sector industry players that have reported March-quarter results so far, the bottom-line results of Mastercard Incorporated MA, The Western Union Company WU and Visa Inc. V beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Mastercard reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.73, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.5%. The bottom line improved 13% year over year. Net revenues of the leading technology company in the global payments industry advanced 14% year over year to $7.3 billion. The top line beat the consensus mark by 1.8%. Gross dollar volume (representing the aggregated dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained from Mastercard-branded cards) increased 9% on a local-currency basis to $2.4 trillion.</p>

The rise in cross-border transaction volumes is proving to be a significant growth driver for the company. In the first quarter of 2025, it reported a 15% year-over-year increase in its cross-border volumes on a local currency basis, reflecting robust growth in international activity.

MA’s total international transactions rose 9% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, followed by 15% year-over-year growth in 2023 and 12.2% year-over-year increase in 2024. The company’s payment network’s net revenues increased 14% year over year in first-quarter 2025, which includes 12% growth in payment network rebates and incentives. Growth in Payment network rebates and incentives was primarily driven by an increase in key drivers and new and renewed deals. We expect the trend to continue and payment network net revenues to witness a nearly 13% year-over-year jump in 2025.

One of the primary drivers of growth is Mastercard&#39;s strategic emphasis on digital payments and fintech collaborations. Its collaboration with Corpay will provide an enhanced suite of corporate cross-border payment solutions.

MA is working on acquiring FinTech Newway to enable the option to settle payments in stablecoins for their merchants. The company’s consumer payment technologies allow it to capture the significant secular opportunity and expand into new markets. However, keeping up this momentum is going to be a challenge due to rising operating costs.

Some of MA’s competitors in the payments solutions space are Visa Inc. V and American Express Company AXP.

Visa reported a 13% year-over-year increase in cross-border volumes in the first quarter of 2025. Over the first half of fiscal 2025, Visa witnessed 14.2% growth in payment volumes. The company estimates net revenues to witness high single-digit to low double-digit growth on an adjusted nominal-dollar basis in fiscal 2025.

American Express reported 13% year-over-year growth in international card services billed business, though its premium customer base shows strong spending resilience in first-quarter 2025. The Global Merchant and Network Services segment’s pre-tax net income fell 3% year over year in the quarter. American Express anticipates revenues to increase between 8% and 10% in 2025.

Year to date, MA’s shares have gained 11.2% compared with the industry’s rise of 8.2%.</p>

The stock has gained over 9% in 2025 and currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.4%. Most analysts rate it as a hold, though LSEG data suggests there’s still over 9% potential upside from current levels.

Despite its leadership position, Intuitive Surgical’s stock remains more than 15% below its all-time high, primarily due to competitive concerns, which may offer a compelling entry point for long-term investors. Given Intuitive Surgical’s strong technological moat, I believe concerns about competition are overstated. The company’s sustained innovation and market leadership position it well to remain a long-term winner.

Thanks to the widespread adoption of its flagship da Vinci system, Intuitive Surgical commands an estimated 60% share of the global robotic surgery market in 2024. Once a system is installed, the company benefits from a steady stream of recurring revenue through the sale of consumables such as surgical instruments. Additionally, hospitals often choose to upgrade their systems over time to stay aligned with the latest technology, further reinforcing this revenue model.

In 2024, Intuitive Surgical generated $8.4 billion in revenue, marking a 17% year-over-year increase—a testament to its ability to effectively monetize its platform. But beyond the strong financials, the company’s intangible advantages significantly deepen its competitive moat. Over the past three decades, the da Vinci system has amassed an extensive base of real-world clinical data, contributing to better patient outcomes—something that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to replicate quickly.

Moreover, Intuitive Surgical is deeply embedded in healthcare systems worldwide. Hospitals invest heavily in training surgical teams, adapting clinical protocols, and integrating the technology into their workflows. This creates substantial switching costs and a high degree of operational lock-in. Even if a competitor were to offer a lower-cost alternative, the economic and logistical barriers to switching remain a significant deterrent.</p>

75-80% complete response rate among evaluable patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose 

MILAN, June 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today the first clinical data from an ongoing Phase 1b study for JNJ-90014496 (JNJ-4496), an investigational dual-targeting anti-CD19/CD20 bispecific autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, being studied in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R LBCL) who have not been previously treated with CAR T-cell therapy.1 Findings demonstrate the potential of JNJ-4496 in the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL, including R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) – the most common type of aggressive lymphoma, a blood cancer that originates in the lymphatic system.1,2 These data were presented as an oral presentation at the 2025 European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress (Abstract #S239).1

JNJ-4496, formerly known as C-CAR039, is a dual-targeting CAR T designed to bind to both CD19 and CD20 antigens — two cell surface proteins commonly expressed on malignant B-cells. This design, including a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, is intended to enhance binding strength and persistence, also potentially addressing common mechanisms of resistance in relapsed or refractory disease.

In the Phase 1b dose confirmation study (NCT05421663) in patients with R/R LBCL, data at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) were reported in patients with a median follow-up of 4 months. Results informed a RP2D of JNJ-4496 at 75 million CAR+ T-cells. Among the 22 patients in the RP2D group where efficacy was assessed, those who received one prior line of therapy (n=10) had an objective response rate (ORR) of 100 percent and a complete response rate (CRR) of 80 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI), 69, 100). In the patients who had received two or more prior lines of therapy (n=12), the ORR was 92 percent and the CRR was 75 percent (95 percent CI, 62, 100).1

&#34;There is a pressing need to continue advancing therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only about 40 percent of patients have long-term remissions with currently available single-antigen-targeting CD19 CAR T therapies,&#34; said Krish Patel*, M.D., Director of Lymphoma Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), and principal study investigator. &#34;The data presented today show encouraging clinical activity and promising safety, and represent a step forward in delivering a potential new treatment option to patients living with the most common type of aggressive lymphoma.&#34;</p>

The company is strategically positioned to benefit from the expanding global endoscopy devices market through its strong innovation pipeline and well-diversified product offerings. Per an Allied Market Research report, the global endoscopy devices market was valued at $28.1 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $44.1 billion by 2032 at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2023 to 2032.

Sales of Endoscopy products totaled $673 million, up 6% both operationally and organically, for the first quarter of 2025. Endoscopy sales accounted for 14% of the company’s overall revenues.

Sales growth can be attributed to steady performance across geographies and BSX’s diverse product suite. A key highlight was the continued double-digit growth of the AXIOS Stent and Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System. AXIOS is the first and only stent indicated for transgastric or transduodenal endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts.

Additionally, the Endoluminal Surgery franchise saw double-digit growth from two innovative technologies — OverStitch and MANTIS Clip. This indicates robust adoption of advanced endoscopic tools aimed at minimally invasive procedures. The segment’s consistent growth is attributed to its balanced regional performance and strong traction in newer, high-potential product lines. Accordingly, Boston Scientific is poised to sustain long-term growth in the high-potential endoscopy space.

Stryker’s SYK Endoscopy segment posted strong growth in the first quarter, with U.S. organic sales rising 11.1%, driven by double-digit gains in core endoscopy and sports medicine portfolios. Key growth catalysts included the 1788 camera platform, as it continues to win customers. Robust global performance and product innovation position the segment for continued success.

Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, through its subsidiary Ethicon, is a key player in the field of endoscopy. The company offers advanced energy-based endoscopic surgery platforms known as ENDOPATH and HARMONIC. Additionally, it provides staplers and suturing devices such as ECHELON and PROXISURE. JNJ’s strategic growth initiatives involve a strong emphasis on digital surgery platforms, artificial intelligence and analytics to enhance endoscopic procedures.

Shares of Boston Scientific have gained 27.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 9.7%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has also grown 11% in the same period.</p>

Phase 1b data show low rate of differentiation syndrome and no cardiac safety signal of QTc prolongation

MILAN, June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced new Phase 1b data showing encouraging antileukemic activity and a promising safety profile for bleximenib (JNJ-75276617) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine (VEN + AZA) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring KMT2A gene rearrangements (KMT2Ar) or NPM1 gene mutations (NPM1m). The study evaluated patients with newly diagnosed, intensive chemo-ineligible AML and relapsed or refractory AML.1 The results were featured in an oral presentation at the 2025 European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress (S137).

Even though AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults, it has the lowest survival rate and is associated with poor patient outcomes, despite treatment advances to date – especially for patients with KMT2Ar and NPM1m.2,3,4

&#34;AML encompasses a spectrum of genetically diverse cancers affecting the bone marrow and blood, which progress rapidly, making it an extremely challenging cancer to treat,&#34; said Andrew M. Wei*, MBBS, PhD, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and University of Melbourne, Australia. &#34;These data highlight the potential of this targeted therapy in combination with VEN + AZA for patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy or with disease that has relapsed after prior therapy.&#34;

The Phase 1b dose-finding study (NCT05453903) evaluated 125 patients with relapsed or refractory AML and newly diagnosed, intensive chemo-ineligible AML who harbored KMT2Ar (n=52) or NPM1m (n=73). Bleximenib in combination with VEN + AZA was evaluated across multiple dose levels without step-up dosing. Of the 85 relapsed or refractory patients, 36 percent received one, 42 percent received two and 12 percent received three lines of prior treatment; 47 percent had previously been treated with venetoclax.1

The bleximenib data at 100 mg twice a day in combination with VEN + AZA showed higher efficacy and a similar safety profile in comparison to other dose levels. At the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), patients with relapsed or refractory AML achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 82 percent and a composite complete response (cCR) rate of 59 percent.1 The newly diagnosed, intensive chemo-ineligible patient population showed an ORR of 90 percent and a cCR rate of 75 percent.1</p>

The double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial involves individuals with active PsA who are biologic naïve and do not have an adequate response to standard treatments.

It includes a 24-week double-blind period, followed by a 24-week active treatment duration and a 12-week safety follow-up.

An additional two-year active treatment period is available for those entering the long-term extension before the final safety follow-up.

The trial demonstrated that this fully-human, dual-acting monoclonal antibody inhibited the advancement of the joint structural damage, along with space narrowing and joint erosions at week 24, as per the PsA modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score measurements.

The mean change from baseline to this week in the modified vdH-S score was found to be 0.55 and 0.54 for those who were being given Tremfya every four weeks (Q4W) and every eight weeks (Q8W), respectively, against 1.35 in the placebo group.

Additionally, 67% (Q4W) and 63% (Q8W) of Tremfya-treated subjects experienced no radiographic progression, against 53% in the placebo group.

According to the company, the antibody also improved joint and skin symptoms in active PsA patients, with significantly greater proportions of patients achieving the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20) at week 24 versus those receiving placebo.

Over twice as many Tremfya-treated subjects achieved ACR50 at week 24. In terms of skin clearance, a greater proportion of patients treated with the antibody achieved an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1, indicating clear or almost clear skin, compared to those on placebo.

The safety profile of the antibody was found to be consistent with previous data, without any safety signals observed.

Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovative Medicine rheumatology disease area leader and vice-president Terence Rooney said: “With these results from the APEX study, Tremfya has set a new bar for joint preservation as the only IL-23 inhibitor proven to significantly inhibit structural damage in active psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory arthritis that can develop in up to 30% of people living with psoriasis.”

Earlier this year, Tremfya also showed success in a Phase III trial for ulcerative colitis, with 27.6% of subjects achieving clinical remission.

Recently, a federal judge ruled that a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary must pay $442 million in damages after a jury concluded last month that the company had broken antitrust laws by withholding support from hospitals that used reprocessed catheters.

U.S. District Judge James Selna ordered the company to pay three times the $147 million in damages awarded by the jury, as permitted under antitrust regulations. This sum does not include legal fees or other related costs.

Daniel Vukelich, CEO of the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors, described the decision as “a seismic result.” In response, a Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) spokesperson said the company intends to appeal the verdict but will comply with the court’s decision and any required relief for now. The spokesperson added, “We strongly disagree with the jury’s verdict and believe it will not withstand appellate review.”

Innovative Health sued Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)&#39;s Biosense Webster in 2019, claiming the company used its market power to block hospitals from using reprocessed heart-mapping catheters by tying support for its Carto 3 system to purchases of its own products.

A jury found Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) violated antitrust laws by withholding support for the reprocessed devices. AMDR’s CEO said the ruling signals that anti-competitive tactics against reprocessing won’t be tolerated. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE: In an opinion article published by The Wall Street Journal, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated, “Vaccines have become a divisive issue in American politics, but there is one thing all parties can agree on: The U.S. faces a crisis of public trust. Whether toward health agencies, pharmaceutical companies or vaccines themselves, public confidence is waning… That is why, under my direction, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is putting the restoration of public trust above any pro- or antivaccine agenda… Today, we are taking a bold step in restoring public trust by totally reconstituting the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices. We are retiring the 17 current members of the committee, some of whom were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration. Without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028… A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.”

DRUG PRICES: Pfizer (PFE) and other drugmakers met with the Trump administration to discuss lowering U.S. drug prices but no commitments have been made, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on Monday at the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference. Boula said the meetings “were cordial,” but they were not “digging into the substance yet,” adding that “it is just trying to understand high-level ideas and no commitments. So what could be the outcomes of something like that? It could be from nothing to very big.”

TRUMP WISHES MUSK WELL: While speaking to reporters from the White House, President Trump said that he wishes Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk “well” and downplayed a dispute with the former DOGE advisor.

LIVE MUSIC VENUES: Live Nation (LYV) CEO Michael Rapino told Fox News Digital that after President Donald Trump’s March executive order targeting ticket scalpers and strengthening protection for artists and their fans that the company is investing $1B to build new and revitalized live music venues in an effort to bring more big shows to smaller cities. “Our mission is simple: help artists deliver more unforgettable live experiences – and in doing so, create jobs, revive cities, and lift up communities we touch,” Live Nation’s Rapino is quoted as having told Fox News.</p>

Both companies have a strong presence in oncology, immunology and neuroscience areas. Other than that, J&amp;J also has drugs for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and infectious diseases, along with a strong presence in the medical devices segment.

On the other hand, Merck boasts a strong presence in vaccines, virology and hospital acute care.

Both firms face looming patent expirations and headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign. But which one is a better investment option today? Let’s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges to make an informed choice.

J&amp;J’s biggest strength is its diversified business model, which helps it to withstand economic cycles more effectively. It operates through more than 275 subsidiaries.

Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend. The segment’s sales rose 4.4% in the first quarter of 2025 on an organic basis despite the loss of exclusivity (LOE) for its multi-billion-dollar product, Stelara, and the negative impact of the Part D redesign. In 2025, J&amp;J expects growth in the Innovative Medicine segment in the face of Stelara biosimilar entrants to be driven by its key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Spravato and Erleada, as well as new drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Talvey, and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant.

J&amp;J also has an interesting R&amp;D pipeline that can generate innovative products and further drive its growth. J&amp;J has been on an acquisition spree lately, with the latest acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies strengthening its presence in the neurological and psychiatric drug market.

Sales in J&amp;J’s MedTech business are facing continued headwinds in the Asia Pacific, specifically in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program and the anticorruption campaign. J&amp;J does not expect any improvement in its business in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, in 2025. Competitive pressure is also hurting sales growth in some MedTech businesses.

The company lost U.S. patent exclusivity of its blockbuster drug, Stelara, in 2025. The launch of generics is expected to significantly erode the drug’s sales, hurting J&amp;J’s sales and profits in 2025. J&amp;J also expects a negative impact of approximately $2 billion in sales due to the Medicare Part D redesign in 2025. The Part D redesign is expected to mainly hurt sales of drugs like Stelara, Tremfya, Erleada and PAH drugs</p>

Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +5.8% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry&#39;s decline of -15.4%. The company&#39;s Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada, and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline.

However, sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is eroding the drug&#39;s sales in 2025. Uncertainty around talc lawsuits remains.

More than 40% of TREMFYA®-treated patients across both dose groups achieved ACR50 at Week 24

Improvement in both joint and skin symptoms reinforce TREMFYA® as a first-line treatment option with a proven safety profile for adults with active psoriatic arthritis

BARCELONA, June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced findings from the Phase 3b APEX study showing that TREMFYA® (guselkumab) significantly reduced both signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and inhibited progression of joint structural damage at 24 weeks compared to placebo.1 These data from a late-breaking abstract are among the 30 oral and poster presentations Johnson &amp; Johnson is highlighting at the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2025 Congress.

In the Phase 3b APEX study, TREMFYA® significantly inhibited progression of joint structural damage, including joint erosions and space narrowing, in patients with active PsA at Week 24 as assessed by the PsA modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score. The mean change from baseline to Week 24 in the modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score was 0.55 and 0.54 for patients receiving TREMFYA® every four weeks (Q4W) and every eight weeks (Q8W) respectively, compared with 1.35 in the placebo group (p=0.002 for Q4W and p&lt;0.001 for Q8W dosing versus placebo, respectively). In the two TREMFYA® dose groups, 67% (Q4W) and 63% (Q8W) of patients experienced no radiographic progression, versus 53% in the placebo group.a,1

&#34;In psoriatic arthritis, joint damage can begin early and progress quickly if left untreated, significantly impacting a patient&#39;s ability to move, work and maintain independence,&#34; said Philip J. Mease, MD, Director of Rheumatology Research at the Swedish Medical Center and study investigator.b &#34;The results of the APEX study are promising as the data show guselkumab to be the only IL-23 inhibitor in its class that has inhibited the progression of structural damage in patients, providing new clinical insights for the psoriatic community and underscoring the need for safe, effective options that address the full burden of disease.&#34;

TREMFYA® also improved both joint and skin symptoms in patients with active PsA.

Significantly greater proportions of TREMFYA®-treated patients (67% for Q4W and 68% for Q8W) achieved American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20c) at Week 24 versus 47% receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001)

More than twice as many patients treated with TREMFYA® achieved ACR50c (41% for Q4W and 42% for Q8W) versus 20% receiving placebo at Week 24.1

In assessing skin clearance, greater proportions of TREMFYA®-treated patients (73% for Q4W and 68% for Q8W) achieved an Investigator&#39;s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1d (clear or almost clear skin) at Week 24 versus 31% receiving placebo.1</p>

It aims to reduce risk factors for surgical leaks and bleeding complications across various specialities.

According to the company, the ETHICON 4000 and ETHICON 3D Reloads feature 3D Staple Technology, a redesigned end effector that offers staple consistency to reduce leak pathways.

Both products have been cleared for use in open and laparoscopic procedures.

The new stapling technology, along with the reloads, is set for future exclusive use with the OTTAVA Robotic Surgical System.

During the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, from 15 to 19 June 2025, the company will display the ETHICON 4000 System and its portfolio of technologies.

Johnson &amp; Johnson noted that the surgical complications, particularly leaks and bleeds at the staple line, pose a significant challenge and financial burden.

The ETHICON 4000 Stapler with ETHICON 3D Reloads addresses these issues, decreasing staple line interventions by 23% against traditional 2D staples.

Since 2017, ETHICON Surgical Stapling devices have been associated with enhanced clinical and economic outcomes in various procedures.

The new ETHICON 4000 Stapler and ETHICON 3D Reloads continue this trend, offering offset closure of staple legs for even compression and better outcomes.

The redesigned stapler reload features enhanced Gripping Surface Technology, optimised to stabilise tissue and minimise tissue slippage.

Johnson &amp; Johnson MedTech Surgery Company Group chairman Hani Abouhalka said: “We are building on a legacy of innovation and trusted performance in surgical instrumentation to offer innovations that address some of the most common and costly surgical complications.

“As surgeons work diligently to meet the changing needs of patients, surgical technology must adapt. Johnson &amp; Johnson MedTech is responding by delivering innovation for consistent and reliable experiences across open, minimally invasive, and robotic surgery.”

The company recently introduced the KINCISE 2 surgical automated system, designed to enhance surgical efficiency in knee and hip revision procedures.

Today’s Featured Research Reports

Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +5.8% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s decline of -15.4%. The company’s Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, and Erleada, and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti, and Tecvayli. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline.

However, sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is eroding the drug’s sales in 2025. Uncertainty around talc lawsuits remains.

Northrop Grumman (NOC) stock gained nearly 4%, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) and RTX (RTX) shares rose 3.6% and 3.3%, respectively.

The three companies supply weapons to Israel through their contracts with the US government.

US stocks were lower at the close, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq off about 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively, while the Dow fell 1.8%. Overnight futures fell nearly 2% in immediate reaction to Israel&#39;s airstrikes, which were first reported near 8:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Oil prices were the biggest mover on Friday, rising as much as 8%.

Defense stocks have been on the rise over the past year, with Friday’s gains bringing RTX stock&#39;s gain to north of 38% over the past year, while Northrop Grumman is up 22%. Lockheed Martin has risen a more modest 6% over that time frame.

Palantir (PLTR), a defense contractor that has benefited both from the bid in defense names and its role in the AI boom, was up a more modest 1.6% Friday. Its stock has soared more than 490% over the last year and is the best performer in the S&amp;P 500 year to date.

RTX has outperformed Wall Street’s expectations since the fourth quarter of 2022. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have beaten analysts’ projections in seven and six of those nine quarters, respectively.

The Trump administration has promised a $1 trillion budget for US defense, but its fiscal 2026 budget looks set to fall short of that goal.

On Thursday night, Israel launched what it called a &#34;preemptive strike&#34; against Iran, targeting its nuclear facilities. The attacks continued into Friday, killing 78 people in Tehran including Iran’s top military leadership.

Iran’s foreign minister described the attacks as a “declaration of war,” and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel “should expect severe punishment.”

US President Trump urged Iran to “make a deal” in a post on Truth Social Friday.

“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” he wrote. “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”

Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated further operations may follow as the country seeks to disrupt Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities, while former President Trump urged Tehran to embrace a U.S.-brokered nuclear deal before it is too late.

The unfolding military and intelligence action raised the specter of all-out war and intensified regional volatility. Investors moved toward safety, monitoring developments that could weigh on global markets and risk appetite.

Oil futures surged about 13% on fears of supply disruptions, reflecting the heightened tension. Energy shares saw gains as traders assessed possible impacts on crude flows through key chokepoints.

Market participants noted that defense-related stocks may attract attention if governments boost spending amid rising security risks. Observers will watch statements from officials and any shifts in diplomatic efforts. The situation remains fluid, with investors bracing for updates on potential retaliation and wider geopolitical fallout.

In October, the U.S. Defense Department put out the call to top Silicon Valley talent to take high-ranking positions in the U.S. Army Reserve so they could periodically be tapped for short-term projects in areas like data and cybersecurity, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

Now, eight months later, Silicon Valley is reporting for duty.

The initial cohort of this program will include the CTOs of Meta and Palantir, Andrew Bosworth and Shyam Sankar, respectively, as originally reported by The Wall Street Journal. It will also include OpenAI executives Kevin Weil, chief product officer, and Bob McGrew, chief research officer.</p>

BBAI is positioning itself at the intersection of artificial intelligence and national security, an increasingly lucrative niche. In first-quarter 2025, the company reported $34.8 million in revenues, up 5% year over year, largely driven by expanding defense and homeland security contracts. Notably, BigBear secured a major win with the Department of Defense for its Orion Decision Support Platform, highlighting its capabilities in mission-critical AI deployment.

Despite this traction, profitability remains elusive. The company posted a net loss of $62 million in the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA swinging deeper into negative territory at $7 million. Still, the balance sheet is improving. BigBear ended the quarter with $108 million in cash and cut its convertible debt from $200 million to $142 million. A growing $385 million backlog, up 30% from last year, suggests strong forward momentum.

CEO Kevin McAleenan’s dual-market strategy, blending national defense and commercial adjacencies, offers a credible growth outline. Investments in scalable products like Pangiam Threat Detection and veriScan are beginning to yield international interest, while alliances and R&amp;D expansion reflect a long-term commitment to innovation.

However, federal procurement delays and lumpy revenue cycles create uncertainty. The company has a history of operating losses and high stock-based compensation. For now, BigBear.ai remains a speculative play riding a powerful macro trend. If execution improves and contract monetization accelerates, the company may just convert defense-led demand into sustainable profitability.

As BigBear.ai seeks to ride the defense AI wave, it faces stiff competition from larger, more established players like Palantir Technologies PLTR and Booz Allen Hamilton BAH, both entrenched in the national security AI space.

Palantir continues to lead the government AI software market with platforms like Gotham, boasting strong federal relationships and consistent profitability. Its deep integration into U.S. defense and intelligence workflows sets a high competitive bar for BigBear.ai, particularly as Palantir expands into AI operating systems with AIP.

Meanwhile, Booz Allen offers robust consulting-led AI deployment across defense and homeland security missions. Its scale, existing contracts, and systems integration capabilities give it a clear edge in delivering turnkey, AI-powered defense solutions.

Shares of BigBear.ai have lost 13.9% year to date (YTD) compared with the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry’s 6.7% decline. </p>

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock&#39;s performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&#39;s +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palantir Technologies falls in, has gained 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock&#39;s future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company&#39;s earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors&#39; interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Palantir Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +55.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.

The consensus earnings estimate of $0.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.73 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Palantir Technologies is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock&#39;s price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palantir Technologies is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>

10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the world we live in. With the technology perhaps being a once-in-a-generation opportunity, it&#39;s not too late to invest in the stocks leading the AI charge.

Let&#39;s look at five leading AI stocks to buy right now.

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI by helping organizations actually put AI to work.

By gathering data and structuring it into an &#34;ontology,&#34; Palantir&#39;s AI platform (AIP) maps digital assets to real-world objects and processes to let customers apply AI to solve real-world problems. AIP is being used for a variety of tasks, from optimizing supply chains to automating underwriting to even monitoring for sepsis in hospitals.

While the company has long been an important government vendor, Palantir&#39;s growth is currently being powered by the U.S. public sector. Given the wide array of applications across industries that AIP can be used for, Palantir has a massive opportunity in front of it.

Recently, Palantir has introduced AI agents within AIP that go beyond analysis to take action. Agentic AI is becoming the next big AI push, and could be a big growth driver for the company.

That said, the stock isn&#39;t cheap, and government budget cuts could potentially impact growth. Still, Palantir&#39;s technology looks unmatched, and the company is well-positioned to be a long-term AI leader.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to be one of the top ways to invest in the AI infrastructure boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of AI data centers thanks to their powerful parallel processing capabilities. And as the engine that helps run AI workloads, demand for GPUs continues to soar as organizations race to build and run AI models and apps.

Nvidia&#39;s real moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform, which it created to make it easier for developers to program its chips. Since then, it has built a powerful suite of tools and libraries that further enhance its GPUs&#39; performance for AI workloads.

The tight integration between its powerful GPUs and CUDA helped Nvidia attain an over 90% share in the GPU market in Q1. Its new Blackwell chips are ramping up faster than any product in its history, and demand for its full-stack AI &#34;factories&#34; continues to surge. Beyond the data center, Nvidia is also gaining traction in the automotive space, with revenue expected to hit $5 billion this year.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has created astounding wealth for shareholders in a very short period. It was the best-performing member of the S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) last year, and the company is leading the index higher again this year. In total, Palantir stock has returned 695% since January 2024 and 2,000% since January 2023.

However, Palantir is also the most expensive stock in the S&amp;P 500, as measured by price-to-sales ratio. In fact, it is one of the most expensive software stocks in recent history, and other every other software stock that had a similar valuation in the last two decades eventually crashed.

Here&#39;s what investors should know.

ChatGPT showed that artificial intelligence (AI) systems could not only generate media content and engage in conversation, but also reason through problems and give concise answers to complex questions. It became the fastest-growing consumer application in history after its launch in late 2022, and businesses have since been racing to infuse their products with generative AI.

Palantir was ideally positioned to capitalize on that trend. The company already developed analytics solutions, so introducing an adjacent artificial intelligence platform that let users engage data conversationally was a natural next step. Palantir introduced such a product in 2023. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is a large language model orchestration tool that lets businesses apply generative AI to their operations.

The company says it is uniquely positioned to meet demand for AI because it has spent years developing its ontology-based software. To elaborate, an ontology is a framework that connects digital data to real-world assets, creating a feedback loop that lets users identify nuanced insights that continuously improve to support better decision-making over time.

AIP lets businesses interact with ontology data in natural language, making it easy to apply generative AI to analytics workflows. Palantir CTO Ryan Taylor said last year, &#34;Our unique capability lies in moving from prototype to production.&#34; In other words, Palantir sees its software as better suited than competing products to helping businesses build AI tools.</p>

Organizations generate a lot of data that is stored in silos, often in incompatible formats, making it slow and costly to extract actionable insights, which in turn drives demand for modern cloud-based data analysis platforms that can efficiently analyze the siloed data.

The 5 data analytics stocks we track reported a strong Q1. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

Luckily, data analytics stocks have performed well with share prices up 16.5% on average since the latest earnings results.

One of the few public companies where famed investor Marc Andreessen is a Board member, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) provides software and hardware to track industrial equipment, assets, and fleets.

Samsara reported revenues of $366.9 million, up 30.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 4.4%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations and a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.

“We delivered a strong first quarter of the new fiscal year with Q1 revenue of $366.9 million, growing 32% year-over-year in constant currency,” said Sanjit Biswas, CEO and co-founder of Samsara.

Samsara pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. The company added 132 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,638. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 14.4% since reporting and currently trades at $40.52.

The firm’s price target adjustment follows remarks made by company executives at the bank’s technology conference this week. It talked about the company’s robust recent performance and significant upward revisions, as well as a rise in comparable multiples.

The new price target is based on projected enterprise value to sales multiples for 2025 and 2026, which are an estimated 80-times and 65-times, respectively.

10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›

Data mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) picked up right where it left off in 2024. Last year, Palantir stock was the top performer in the S&amp;P 500 index, as well as the third-best stock in the Nasdaq-100. So far in 2025, things haven&#39;t changed much for the artificial intelligence (AI) software player -- as shares have rocketed by an eye-popping 74% as of this writing (June 10).

While the momentum doesn&#39;t appear to be slowing down at all for Palantir, my prediction is that the stock will plummet during the second half of the year.

Let&#39;s explore some of the trends fueling Palantir stock right now, as well as some interesting breadcrumbs that could support my idea that shares are headed for a sell-off.

Should you dump your Palantir position right now? Read on to find out.

There is a lot that can be gathered from the chart below. The obvious takeaway is that Palantir&#39;s price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 105 is significantly higher than any of the software growth stocks in this peer set. However, the bigger idea from the analysis below is that Palantir&#39;s valuation continues to expand.

These dynamics imply that investors are buying Palantir stock in droves. The deeper question I&#39;ve been asking is: Who are the investors that keep chasing Palantir&#39;s momentum?

Based on some recent clues, I think I might have an answer.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the original Palantir bulls on Wall Street. Shortly following the company&#39;s IPO in late 2020, Wood appeared on financial news programs on a regular basis -- constantly talking about her excitement around Palantir and the company&#39;s ability to disrupt legacy software providers. While this was a great source of indirect PR for Palantir, Wood shocked the investment world when she dumped her stake sometime in 2022.

Following these moves, Wood started accumulating a position in Palantir stock once again in 2023. Per the graph in the prior section, Ark Invest&#39;s position in Palantir is sitting on a healthy profit considering shares now hover around all-time highs. Wood has taken note of these trends, and the famous tech investor is once again reducing her exposure to Palantir.</p>

Voyager (NYSE:VOYG), a space and defense tech firm founded in 2019, has officially hit the public markets with some serious momentum behind it, with the share price jump 120% on the first day of trading. The company&#39;s backlog stood at $179.2 million as of March 31. That includes a $217.5 million contract from NASA to build Starlabits potential successor to the ISSalongside Airbus, Mitsubishi, and Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Voyager was also tapped by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to provide propulsion and optical guidance systems for U.S. missile defense. These aren&#39;t vanity deals. They&#39;re core infrastructure plays that could become critical under the Trump administration&#39;s proposed $175 billion Golden Dome missile shield.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with LMT.

The listing follows a strong run from Karman (NYSE:KRMN), another space-defense player that doubled post-IPO. Lukas Muehlbauer at IPOX said high barriers to entry may limit IPO candidates, but strong government backing and surging defense budgets are pulling more seasoned players into the market. Voyager looks like one of them. Asset managers like Janus Henderson and Wellington Management have shown interest in buying up to $60 million worth of shares. Meanwhile, Rob Desborough of Seraphim Space called the IPO a key moment that shows the sector is maturingand possibly ready for broader institutional capital.

The takeaway? Between NASA contracts, missile defense exposure, and major investor interest, Voyager&#39;s public debut could be more than just a one-off. As geopolitical risks rise and governments pour money into aerospace, firms like Voyager may find themselves sitting on long-duration tailwinds. It&#39;s early, and execution still mattersbut for investors looking beyond Earth, this could be a name worth tracking.

Citi analyst Tyler Radke maintained a &#34;Neutral&#34; rating and kept his $115 price target unchanged, cautioning that Palantir&#39;s valuation looks stretched unless it can land more substantial contracts soon. The company&#39;s shares have surged on AI enthusiasm, but Radke argued the fundamentals don&#39;t yet support its market price.

Following a meeting with Palantir management, Citi acknowledged progress with the company&#39;s Artificial Intelligence Platform, which blends legacy data systems with generative AI. While adoption is rising, Radke highlighted ongoing structural concerns, including uneven growth and overreliance on symbolic wins. A recent deal with Citi&#39;s own financial division was seen as promising but not enough to justify the high expectations.

Palantir&#39;s long-standing position as a key U.S. government contractor is also under pressure. Citi flagged recent volatility in federal deal flow due to budget constraints and leadership changes linked to the Trump administration.

Speculation continues around Palantir&#39;s possible role in the Golden Dome missile-defense initiative, but the company has yet to confirm any revenue linked to the project.

Valuation metrics remain elevated. Palantir&#39;s forward P/E exceeds 210, while its enterprise value-to-sales ratio nears 72, well above historical averages for software firms. Citi warned that without meaningful new deals, the stock&#39;s premium pricing could unravel quickly.

PLTR currently has a return on equity (ROE) of 23.56%, trailing the industry average of 32.34%. While still solid, this disparity suggests that Palantir is generating less profit per dollar of shareholder equity compared to its peers. For investors, ROE is a critical measure of management’s effectiveness at deploying capital. A lower ROE may signal weaker efficiency or a more capital-intensive business model, potentially raising concerns about long-term value creation.

However, context matters. Palantir&#39;s focus on long-cycle contracts and heavy investment in product development and infrastructure could be weighing down short-term returns while setting the stage for sustainable future growth. The company’s shift toward modular sales and usage-based pricing may also temporarily impact margins while expanding its client base.

Still, for investors comparing Palantir to faster-scaling, high-efficiency software firms, the ROE gap can’t be ignored. It highlights a trade-off between Palantir’s strategic positioning and its current capital efficiency. Long-term investors may be willing to overlook near-term underperformance if they believe in the company’s trajectory, but those focused on immediate returns might prefer firms with stronger ROE profiles.

In the current environment, ROE remains a key metric to watch as Palantir executes its broader commercial expansion strategy.

Investors eyeing strong capital efficiency may look beyond Palantir to names like ServiceNow NOW and CrowdStrike CRWD. ServiceNow continues to impress with scalable margins and consistent ROE growth. ServiceNow also benefits from sticky enterprise clients and deep penetration in IT workflows.

Meanwhile, CrowdStrike delivers robust returns through its cloud-native security platform. CrowdStrike has expanded margins, accelerated ARR, and grown its enterprise base, all while maintaining high ROE.

As ServiceNow and CrowdStrike show, high return on equity can signal strong capital deployment and financial discipline. For those prioritizing return-driven growth, both ServiceNow and CrowdStrike offer compelling alternatives to lower-ROE peers.

On Wednesday, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) acquired 227,698 GitLab shares for roughly $11 million. The purchase came as GTLB fell about 11% despite reporting Q1 fiscal 2026 results: earnings of $0.17 per share versus an expected $0.15 and revenue of $214.5 million, up about 27% year on year against forecasts near $213 million.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with GTLB.

ARKW also increased its stake in Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM) by buying 349,000 shares, reflecting confidence in biotech exposure.

Meanwhile, ARKK offloaded 98,362 Roblox shares worth over $9 million. ARK funds sold 55,829 Palantir shares across ARKK, ARKQ, and ARKX for about $7.4 million, and 12,728 CoreWeave shares for approximately $2 million.

Investors can consider these changes as an indication of how ARK is focusing on changing perceived growth opportunities and risk management. With the market conditions changing, monitoring the performance of these holdings may provide a guide to the mood in software, biotech, and AI-related names.

What we&#39;re reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Nearly halfway through 2025, it&#39;s clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.

In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.

Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 2.6% gain.

Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means &#34;the health of the broader economy is improving.&#34;

Across the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market&#39;s most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.

Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have risen 5.32%.

As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president&#39;s Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.

AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year&#39;s biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.

AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year&#39;s biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).

And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.</p>

The two tech giants have taken minority stakes in Skild AI, a startup building software to power autonomous robots. Nvidia is investing $25 million. Samsung is putting in $10 million. The deal is part of a Series B round led by SoftBank, which is anchoring the raise with a $100 million commitment that pegs Skild&#39;s valuation at around $4.5 billion. While Nvidia is leaning in to expand its physical AI footprint, Samsung sees this as a low-risk way to stay close to the actionespecially with local rivals like LG, Hanwha, and Mirae Asset also quietly joining the round with $510 million each.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with SSNLF.

For Nvidia, this isn&#39;t just another side bet. The company has been steadily positioning itself as the engine room behind autonomous machinesoffering chips, software, and developer tools for what it calls physical AI. Skild could slot neatly into that narrative. Samsung, on the other hand, appears to be taking a more cautious view. Insiders say the Korean giant doesn&#39;t rate all of Skild&#39;s solutions as best-in-class, but it still wants access to the startup&#39;s team and roadmap. This isn&#39;t Samsung&#39;s first robotics foray either. It&#39;s invested in Physical Intelligence, controls a stake in Rainbow Robotics, and is preparing to launch the Ballie robot with Googlea soccer-ball-shaped bot that can project video onto walls.

Meanwhile, the broader robotics land grab is gaining momentum. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is prepping its Optimus robot for commercialization. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also racing to build their own next-gen humanoids. These aren&#39;t just futuristic moonshots anymorethey&#39;re shaping up to be real businesses. And Skild&#39;s latest round, backed by three of the world&#39;s biggest tech investors, signals just how serious this new frontier is becoming. The physical world might be robotics&#39; next platformand no one wants to be left behind.

Since last Friday, shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) fell nearly 15% as of the market close on Thursday. The stock also traded lower on Friday. While the quantum computing sector experienced some good news this week, D-Wave also announced an at-the-market (ATM) stock offering to potentially raise new capital.

D-Wave&#39;s ATM offering is with several brokerages and investment banks and will allow the company from time to time to conduct the &#34;issuance and sale&#34; of common stock for up to $400 million. The word issuance indicates that new shares could be offered to raise capital, which would be dilutive to existing shareholders.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission( SEC), D-Wave also said that cash balances on hand as of March 31 are enough &#34;to fund the company to profitability.&#34; D-Wave plans to use any potential proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures (capex), acquiring new companies, or expanding the business, as well as for general working capital purposes.

The news is disappointing because it comes during a week when Nvidia&#39;s CEO Jensen Huang praised quantum computing. &#34;We are within reach of being able to apply quantum computing in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years,&#34; he said. Few CEOs can move the market, but Huang is one of them, being one of the most influential people in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Other quantum computing stocks jumped this week.

Shareholders never like to see dilutive capital raises, but with D-Wave trading at an extremely high valuation, this is often when management will try and bring in additional capital to fund growth. Either way, it&#39;s been an incredible run. D-Wave&#39;s stock is up 1,268% over the last year and currently trades at 191 times forward sales.

While D-Wave appears to be making real progress toward eventually mass producing quantum computers, it&#39;s very difficult to buy stocks at these kinds of meteoric valuations. I wouldn&#39;t recommend anything more than a small, speculative position at this time.

The firm highlighted that “European catch-up investment, quantum/classical opportunities, and industrial/physical AI were the main focus,” all of which provide “incremental growth” on top of the broader AI boom.

At the event, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) emphasized accelerating EU investment. “Earlier this year the EU launched a €200 billion initiative for AI investment,” with €20 billion earmarked to help finance five AI gigafactories.

Nvidia’s own announcements included plans requiring “more than 3,000 exaflops of NVIDIA Blackwell compute,” including “an 18k GB200 phase one deployment with Mistral in France” and “a 14k Blackwell development in the UK.”

The company also plans to build “the world’s first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers” and new AI centers across Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, the U.K. and Finland.

Morgan Stanley said the keynote reflected Nvidia’s shift toward “robotics and physical AI,” noting, “investment is happening now.” The firm estimates European GPU revenue could grow “8x or more from CY24 to CY26.”

CEO Jensen Huang was said to have been “more constructive on a timeline for hybrid GPU/QPU systems” and reiterated Nvidia’s strategy of complementing quantum computing with classical simulation tools.

Nvidia also expanded its DGX Cloud Lepton marketplace with AWS and Azure joining smaller compute providers, aiming to “make it easier for developers to manage, monitor, and deploy their compute resources globally.”

Despite management’s usual conservative tone, Morgan Stanley said, “We would characterize management as highly confident,” adding that “NVIDIA is outgrowing ASIC competitors meaningfully.” The firm reiterated its Overweight rating and kept Nvidia as its “Top Pick in semis.”

10 stocks we like better than Quantum Computing ›

Shares of Quantum Computing (NASDAQ: QUBT) are surging this week, up 24.2% as of 1:22 p.m. ET. The jump comes as the S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) both had modest gains.

At his company&#39;s GTC Paris developer conference on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang indicated that he thinks quantum computing is reaching an &#34;inflection point,&#34; boosting stocks across the industry.

Earlier this year, Huang sent quantum stocks sliding after he said he believes useful quantum computers were 15 years or more away. He later qualified his remarks and walked them back somewhat, even hosting executives from around the industry to &#34;tell him why he was wrong.&#34;

On Wednesday, however, he went much further, making the most directly bullish comments thus far. Huang said that he believes the industry is nearing an &#34;inflection point&#34; and that &#34;we are within reach&#34; of being able to apply the technology &#34;in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.&#34;

As much as this seems a significant departure from his original stance, it seems to me that investors may be reading past what Huang actually said. There&#39;s a difference between solving &#34;some interesting problems&#34; and the full maturation of quantum technology that delivers on its transformative promise. There is plenty of reason to believe Huang&#39;s original timeline for the latter.

And given the enormous market capitalizations of these quantum stocks, including Quantum Computing, the technology must be transformative. I think we are still a very long way from a quantum computer that is robust, powerful, and stable enough to generate a return on the current level of investment. I would stay away from Quantum Computing stock for the time being.

Huang has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration’s export restrictions as limiting U.S. manufacturing and growth opportunities. Export controls may loosen as a result of a trade deal with China in exchange for greater access to rare earths.

AI chipmaker Nvidia will no longer include Chinese business in its financial forecasts after President Donald Trump’s efforts to tighten export controls to China.

CEO Jensen Huang told CNN on Thursday that a trade deal between the U.S. and China would be “a great bonus,” but he wasn’t counting on that outcome.

“I’ve told all of our investors and shareholders that, going forward, our forecasts will not include the China market,” he said.

The Department of Commerce last month initiated a series of export controls that would revoke a Biden-era “diffusion” rule capping the number of chips other countries are able to buy, while also “warning the public about the potential consequences of allowing U.S. AI chips to be used for training and interference of Chinese AI models.” Weeks later, the administration reportedly restricted chip design software companies like Synopsys and Siemens from selling to China without a U.S. government license, according to Bloomberg.

While Huang touted the removal of the “diffusion” rule as helping to bolster U.S. manufacturing, he’s concerned the crackdown on trade with China will have the opposite effect. The export controls on China have had a tangible impact on Nvidia, which, despite reporting a blockbuster 69% increase in quarterly revenue, missed out on $2.5 billion in revenue from being unable to ship its H20 chips to China, the company said. Nvidia’s H20 chips, less powerful than their Blackwell counterparts, were designed specifically to comply with U.S. export controls on the country and resulted in a $4.5 billion charge due to excess inventory, still less than the $5.5 billion expected.

Huang warned more broadly of the dangers of export controls. He doubled down on previous comments that rather than cutting China off from a burgeoning resource in U.S. semiconductor chips, the restrictions are actually spurring the country to jump-start its own development efforts.

“The goals of the export controls are not being achieved,” Huang told CNN. “Whatever those goals are that were being discussed initially, [they] are apparently not working. And so I think, with all export controls, the goals have to be well-articulated and tested over time.”</p>

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.

Nvidia said it is partnering with AI teams in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, and beyond to fine-tune large language models using its Nemotron architecture and post-training pipeline. The goal: deliver open-source, sovereign AI systems that run efficiently and locally.

Participating organizations include the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Bielik.AI, LightOn, Dicta, and several national research institutes and universities. Models will be optimized with synthetic data and neural architecture search, and will be accessible as Nvidia NIM microservices on local cloud infrastructure via DGX Cloud Lepton.

The models will also integrate with Hugging Face and Perplexity, an AI search engine already answering more than 150 million questions per week. Perplexity will incorporate the sovereign models to improve region-specific relevance and transparency for European users.

Europe&#39;s diversity is its superpower, said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, adding that locally developed intelligence would help power digital transformation across manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and media.

Initial model releases are expected later this year.

The chipmaker is so convinced of that fact that it’s not going to include the Chinese market in its revenue and profit forecasts, CEO Jensen Huang told CNN on Thursday.

Huang said he’s not counting on the Trump administration reversing its chip export controls and that it would be a nice “bonus” if they did.

The Trump administration introduced licensing requirements for Nvidia’s H20 chips, the most advanced AI chip it could sell to China, in April. In its first-quarter results, the company said these restrictions would result in an $8 billion hit to its revenue in the second quarter.

When contacted about this development, a Nvidia spokesperson pointed to remarks Huang made about China on the company’s Q1 earnings call.</p>

But the tide has shifted positively over the past year, with several notable IPOs hitting the market, including CoreWeave CRWV and Circle Internet Group CRCL. Both stocks have seen big runs in June.

In short, CRWV provides exposure to the AI frenzy, whereas CRCL is a play on the mainstreaming of digital dollars and the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape.

Let’s take a closer glance at each.

Given its backing by AI-favorite NVIDIA NVDA, the IPO reflected one of the most exciting we’ve seen in years. An SEC filing in late May 2025 revealed NVIDIA has a $900 million stake, reflecting one of its largest investors.

It’s also important to know that NVIDIA supplies CoreWeave with most of its high-performance GPUs that power CRWV’s AI infrastructure. Some time back, investors raised flags concerning the massive amount of sales NVIDIA generated from CRWV, but that concern has since evaporated.

The company’s latest set of quarterly results were driven by accelerating demand for its AI offerings, with sales up a staggering 420% year-over-year. Revenue backlog totaled a strong $25.9 billion, with CRWV also securing more lucrative deals with enterprises.

Up 270% since its IPO, the stock remains a great play on the AI frenzy, which appears to still be in the early innings.

Circle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and financial applications worldwide. It’s the issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, widely used across exchanges, DeFi platforms, and institutional trading venues.

But what does that even mean? CEO Jeremy Allaire explains simply –

‘If you could take what we think of as money, make it digital and available on the internet, then that would dramatically change the way we use money and open up opportunity around the world. That’s the idea behind Circle.’

Below is an image displaying the company’s platform in greater detail.

Since their debut on June 5th, shares have went on a massive run. It’s worth noting that Cathie Wood’s ARK had a big win on the stock, purchasing roughly 4.5 million shares on its first day of trading.

The stock overall reflects a great play on the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape, which is also just seemingly beginning as we increasingly wade into the digital age.</p>

His remarks came during CNBC&#39;s VivaTech conference coverage in Paris.

Huang warned that by restricting AI chip sales to China, the U.S. may accelerate China&#39;s move to develop a separate technology stack. Huawei, he said, is already in position to cover China and much of the rest of the world if U.S. companies exit the market.

If the United States doesn&#39;t want to partake in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered, Huang told CNBC.

While emphasizing that Nvidia&#39;s technology remains a generation ahead, Huang cautioned that allowing China to retain most of the world&#39;s AI developers could shift global momentum. If all the AI developers are in China, [the] China stack is going to win, he said.

The comments come amid escalating U.S.China tech tensions. The Biden administrationnow succeeded by President Donald Trumppreviously moved to revoke student visas and warned against using Chinese chips. In response, China has supported domestic chipmakers like Huawei to fill the gap.

Huang added that it was his job to advise the Trump administration on how export curbs could backfire. He has a game plan. I trust him, and we&#39;ll support him the best we can, he said of the president.

Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei also acknowledged this week that the company&#39;s AI chips still trail the U.S. in performance, but called on Chinese engineers to work harder.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMD.

The MI355X is part of AMD&#39;s new CDNA 4 architecture and is optimized for AI inference. With support for FP4, FP6, FP8, and FP16 precision, the MI355X delivers up to 20.1 PFLOPS in FP4/FP6 workloads and 10.1 PFLOPS in FP8, slightly ahead of Nvidia&#39;s B300 at 15 FP4 PFLOPS.

To support this performance, the MI355X consumes 1,400W peak, nearly doubling the 750W required by its predecessor, the MI300X. AMD expects some users may still air-cool the chip, but liquid cooling is the standard.

The GPU includes 288 GB of HBM3E memory with bandwidth reaching 8 TB/s. A scaled 8-way configuration brings system-level performance to 161 PFLOPS (FP4) and 80.5 PFLOPS.

While raw compute marks a win on paper, AMD still trails Nvidia in deployment scale and software ecosystem. Pegatron is reportedly preparing a 128-way MI350X system, but Nvidia remains dominant in large-scale AI training clusters.

AMD&#39;s Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said zettascale supercomputing by 2035 will require processors consuming up to 2,000W each. He projected that future AI systems may need nuclear-scale powerup to 500 MW per machine.

The incident involved a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that had been in service since 2014. The aircraft, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick.

While the cause of the crash is still under investigation, analysts noted the aircraft&#39;s historically strong safety record.

“The crash represents the first fatal accident involving a 787 since the type entered service in September 2011,” said Jefferies (JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu.

Despite this, the 787’s entry into service was marked by early technical issues, including a spate of battery-related incidents in 2013 that led to a temporary global grounding of the model. The aircraft has since maintained a robust operational record.

Boeing (BA) has spent much of the past year attempting to restore its reputation amid a series of safety and quality control issues, namely its 737 MAX programme.

“Considering the long safety record of the 787 aircraft, investors view the market pullback of Boeing’s (BA) stock as overdone as the 737 MAX production rates improve,” said Kristine Liwag, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS).

Shares in Adobe (ADBE) fell 1.9% ahead of the US market opening after the company reported earnings that did not convince investors.

The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $5.06 a share on sales of $5.87bn in the quarter ended May 30. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Adobe (ADBE) to earn $4.97 a share on sales of $5.8bn. On a year-over-year basis, Adobe earnings rose 13% while sales increased 11%.

Looking ahead, Adobe (ADBE) raised its full-year revenue forecast for fiscal 2025 to a range of $23.5bn to $23.6bn, slightly above its previous guidance of $23.3bn to $23.55bn. The company also raised its adjusted profit outlook, now projecting earnings between $20.50 and $20.70 per share, up from its previous range of $20.20 to $20.50.

Excluding items, it raised its full-year profit to between $20.50 and $20.70 per share, from its prior range of $20.20 to $20.50 each.

Buoyed by strong top-line performance, management reaffirmed its full-year revenue outlook of €30 billion to €35 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 15% at the mid-point. The company is attributing the growth to stem from sustained customer investment in advanced logic and memory nodes.

Bookings in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled €3.9 billion, with 60% coming from logic customers and 40% from memory. This reflects strong momentum in both segments. Logic demand continues to be driven by leading-edge nodes. Management also expects Memory revenues to remain strong. This is driven by growth in ASML’s installed base, an increasing contribution from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and a rise in revenues from its upgrade business.

Additionally, on the technology front, all NXE:3800E systems are now being shipped at full specification, supporting 220 wafers per hour, mature for high volume manufacturing. These systems are ramping up in both logic and memory applications, with high NA EUV enabling customers with shorter cycle time and lower costs, resulting in better yield.

ASML has also made progress in High NA EUV, having shipped its fifth and final NXE:5000 system during the first quarter. In total, five systems have been delivered to three customers. ASML has earlier stated that it plans to begin shipments of the NXE:5200, a follow-on to its High NA system model, from the second quarter of 2025. 

With rising tool adoption in both logic and memory and increasing customer confidence in EUV and High NA roadmaps, ASML’s growth momentum is likely to continue in the near term. ASML remains well-positioned to stay within its full-year guidance range, supporting the company&#39;s belief that 2025 and 2026 will be growth years.

Applied Materials AMAT expects strong momentum in foundry-logic and DRAM. Additionally, AMAT is projecting over 40% growth in DRAM revenues for fiscal 2025. Applied Materials is attributing the growth to be driven by increased adoption of the Sym3 Magnum etch system and Cold Field Emission eBeam in high-bandwidth memory and gate-all-around applications.

Lam Research LRCX reported a record quarter for foundry revenues in its third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth was driven by LRCX’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging spending. DRAM demand remains strong, especially for enabling DDR5, LPDDR5, and High Bandwidth Memory. Lam Research’s new Akara etch and Altus Halo molybdenum platforms are key enablers in logic and memory scaling.</p>

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, management projected that revenues from its advanced DRAM customers to grow more than 40% in fiscal 2025. The growth is likely to be driven by an increase in demand for AMAT’s DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory.

During the last earnings call, Applied Materials noted continued customer adoption of its products across DRAM applications. For example, its Sym3 Magnum etch system has generated more than $1.2 billion in revenues since its launch in February 2024.

Moreover, Applied Materials’ Cold Field Emission eBeam technology is generating strong momentum in gate-all-around transistors and high-bandwidth memory. This helped AMAT generate record revenues in its Process Diagnostics and Control Business during the second quarter of fiscal 2025.

Management emphasized that Applied Materials is focused on the most critical steps for next-generation DRAM and believes this has helped establish a strong leadership position. The company projects a substantial rise in leading-edge DRAM investments through 2025, driven by increased investments in the wafer fab equipment market and 3D DRAM.

Applied Materials’ sustained focus on strengthening product capabilities will help the company expand its opportunities within the memory market.

Lam Research LRCX, in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, stated that DRAM accounted for 23% of its systems revenues. This was supported by LRCX’s customer investments in DDR5, LPDDR5, and high-bandwidth memory. Additionally, Lam Research secured multiple critical etch wins at a major DRAM manufacturer with its new Akara etch system, which supports 3D DRAM architectures.

ASML Holding ASML, in the first quarter of 2025, highlighted strong customer demand for its products. The demand was driven by ASML’s DRAM and logic customers, which are ramping leading-edge nodes using ASML’s NXE:3800E EUV systems. Additionally, ASML noted that multiple DRAM customers are adopting EUV lithography, which helps in shortening cycle time and lowering costs.

Shares of Applied Materials have gained 6.8% year to date compared with the Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 4.3%.

10 stocks we like better than ASML ›

Artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting many industries thanks to the efficiency gains that the technology can bring, such as by automating tasks or predicting potential challenges that a business may face. Because of that, spending on AI solutions and infrastructure has been growing at an incredible pace.

Companies benefiting directly from this saw nice surges in their stock prices, a fact reflected in the 67% jump that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index managed in the past three years. However, not every company that saw its growth rate expand thanks to the proliferation of AI experienced share price gains to match.

Let&#39;s take a look at two such names that aren&#39;t among Wall Street&#39;s favorite AI stocks right now, but that could become winning investments in the long run because of their robust growth potential.

While demand for AI chips surged in the past couple of years, share prices of semiconductor bellwether ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) failed to reflect this booming market. Though the company sells vital advanced chipmaking equipment to the world&#39;s leading foundries and chipmakers, ASML&#39;s stock rose just 5% in the past couple of years.

One reason is that the company had an underwhelming 2024. Its revenue barely increased while earnings fell on account of weakness in chip demand for markets such as personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Though ASML got an AI-powered boost because its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are necessary for manufacturing the most advanced AI chips that go into servers, smartphones, and PCs, and other devices, the company&#39;s growth hasn&#39;t been robust enough.

However, ASML&#39;s growth improved substantially in 2025&#39;s first quarter. Its revenue increased by 46% year over year in Q1, while its earnings almost doubled. Moreover, it received new equipment orders worth nearly 4 billion euros in Q1, up by nearly 10% from the prior-year period.

The Dutch company now forecasts 32.5 billion euros in revenue this year at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a 15% improvement over 2024. However, there is a strong possibility that it could end up growing faster owing to AI. On its earnings conference call in April, CEO Christophe Fouquet remarked:</p>

Robust demand from a wide range of industries has significantly boosted revenues for the semiconductor sector in recent quarters.

The steady demand for semiconductors was a major driver of last year’s overall market rally.

Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in semiconductor stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, Texas Instruments TXN, ASML Holding N.V. ASML and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. AEIS. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported that global chip sales jumped 2.5% sequentially in April, reaching $57 billion, up from $55.6 billion in March. Year over year, semiconductor sales jumped 22.7%. This marks the 11th straight month of year-over-year sales growth above 17%.

John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, “Global semiconductor demand remains high, with first-quarter sales substantially outpacing the first quarter of last year. Year-to-year sales increased by more than 17% for the 11th consecutive month, driven by a year-to-year sales increase of roughly 45% in the Americas.”

Earlier in the year, monthly sales dipped slightly due to concerns over the impact of the budget-friendly Chinese AI platform DeepSeek on U.S. tech firms. However, those worries quickly faded as analysts concluded that the fears were exaggerated.

April’s strong numbers came after an impressive 2024, when global semiconductor sales reached $627.6 billion — a 19.1% jump from $526.8 billion in 2023. The final quarter of 2024 alone saw $170.9 billion in sales, up 17.1% from the same period a year earlier, and 3% higher than the previous quarter.

The steady rise in sales has been driven by robust demand for chips in data centers. Also, the memory chip market is helping boost sales. With ongoing AI investments by tech companies, industry experts expect demand to remain high, with the SIA forecasting continued double-digit growth in 2025.

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) previously projected a double-digit growth in 2025, further boosting optimism about the sector’s ongoing expansion.

Despite ongoing concerns around industry cyclicality and China-related headwinds, ASML continues to solidify its dominance in a space where it faces virtually no actual competition. As 2026 draws nearer, investors may want to tune out the noise and focus on what’s unfolding beneath the surface—a company poised to enter a fresh multi-year growth phase, fueled by its unmatched “NA EUV” technology and a rising tide of national semiconductor reshoring efforts. I remain bullish on ASML, as the company is still in the early stages of commercializing its core offering.

Let’s begin with what might be the most open secret in tech: ASML has no true rivals when it comes to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. None. It is the sole manufacturer of these incredibly complex machines, which are essential for producing chips at the most advanced process nodes. Whether it’s the cutting-edge processors powering AI data centers or flagship smartphones, chances are they were built using ASML’s EUV technology.

These machines don’t come cheap. A single EUV scanner can cost upwards of $200 million, contains over 100,000 precision-engineered parts, and takes more than a year to assemble. Yet, chipmaking giants like TSMC (TSM), Intel (INTC), and Samsung (SSNLF) have no alternatives—they simply queue up and wait.

That exclusivity has allowed ASML to build a massive moat, not through pricing power alone, but through an unmatched technological lead. Even deep-pocketed rivals like Nikon (NINOY) and Canon (CAJPY) have exited the EUV race entirely. ASML doesn’t just lead the market—it is the market.

Concerns about export restrictions, particularly involving China, have surfaced in recent quarters. While it’s true that China accounted for 29% of ASML’s 2023 revenue, no EUV machines have ever been shipped there. The tighter Dutch export controls—largely encouraged by U.S. pressure—mainly apply to high-end DUV tools. Though valuable, these sales were never the cornerstone of ASML’s long-term strategy.</p>

ASML makes advanced machines that are used to manufacture chips, while Texas Instruments designs and sells analog and embedded chips that go into many everyday electronics.

These companies serve different parts of the chip supply chain, but both are key to the global semiconductor market. However, from an investment point of view, one stock offers a more favorable outlook than the other right now. Let’s see which one is a better investment option for now.

ASML Holding has a clear advantage in the chip equipment market. It is the only company capable of producing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines at scale. These machines are needed to make chips at 5nm, 3nm and soon 2nm levels — key to powering AI processors, mobile devices and data centers.

The company is already rolling out its next-generation High-NA EUV machines, which will be used for even smaller chips. As demand for faster and more efficient chips rises, especially with the growth of AI, ASML Holding stands to benefit. Its machines are a necessary part of the chip supply chain, and its customers, including TSMC, Intel and Samsung, will rely on ASML’s technology for years to come.

Financially, ASML Holding is performing well. In the first quarter of 2025, it reported revenue growth of 46% and a 93% jump in earnings per share. For the full year, it expects revenues to increase 15%, which shows continued demand, even in a challenging global environment.

However, one concern is the company’s exposure to China. In 2024, China made up 41% of ASML’s shipments. U.S. pressure on the Dutch government has led to export restrictions on some of ASML’s most advanced equipment, which could limit future sales in that market. Still, strong demand from other regions may offset that risk.

Texas Instruments takes a very different approach. It focuses on analog and embedded chips, which are essential but not high-growth. These chips are widely used in industrial systems, cars and consumer electronics. Its biggest strength lies in its deep exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, which together made up 70% of first-quarter 2025 revenues.

The company sees long-term growth opportunities in areas like robotics, electric vehicles and infrastructure automation. Its embedded processors and analog chips are key components in these systems. In the first quarter, industrial revenues grew at an upper-single-digit pace, while automotive continued to recover, growing modestly. With customer inventory levels still low, Texas Instruments sees room for more improvement in the coming quarters.</p>

The company is well-positioned to benefit from powerful tailwinds, including relentless AI-driven demand, a dominant—nearly monopolistic—position in advanced chip manufacturing, ongoing geographic diversification, and a steady cadence of technological breakthroughs.

TSMC continues to be the principal manufacturer and primary supplier of chips for leading AI powerhouses, including Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple (AAPL), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Notably, TSM is also the producer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell chip series, which has recently gained immense popularity.

TSMC’s 3nm process currently represents the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry, delivering superior power efficiency and performance. Looking ahead, anticipation is building around the company’s upcoming 2nm and 1.6nm nodes, scheduled for launch in late 2025 and 2026, respectively.

The 2nm technology, referred to as N2, remains on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. This next-generation process is expected to deliver a 10–15% improvement in processing speed at the same power consumption, or a 20–30% reduction in power usage at equivalent performance. Following that, the 1.6nm process is projected to further improve power efficiency by an additional 15–20% over the 2nm node.

These advancements are especially timely, as data centers grapple with rising energy costs. The shift to more power-efficient chips is becoming not only a technological imperative but also an economic necessity. This positions TSMC as a key enabler in the ongoing global semiconductor upgrade cycle.

Reflecting this momentum, TSMC has outlined strong long-term growth expectations. The company projects its AI-related chip revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% over the next five years, while overall revenue is forecast to grow at a 20% CAGR during the same period. These figures underscore the company’s pivotal role in powering the future of computing.

Such growth potential hasn’t gone unnoticed. Famous investor Cathie Wood’s Ark funds recently purchased 241,047 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, worth $46.3 million, signaling firm institutional conviction.</p>

ASML, a Dutch company, plays a critical but often understated role in the semiconductor industry by producing the highly complex extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines essential for manufacturing the world’s most advanced chips. Its technology works by generating EUV light through an intricate process involving vaporized tin droplets and lasers inside a vacuum chamber, with precision-engineered multilayer mirrors and reticles transferring chip patterns onto silicon wafers with extraordinary accuracy. The company’s machines operate with near-perfect environmental controls, managing temperature within thousandths of a degree and positioning wafers with micrometer precision, reflecting an unparalleled level of engineering sophistication that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate.

Despite holding significant pricing power, ASML chooses not to excessively raise prices, balancing profitability with the broader goal of supporting ongoing research and innovation in the tech ecosystem, maintaining around 50% gross margins. The Dutch government recognizes ASML’s strategic importance and supports its growth through initiatives like Project Beethoven, aimed at expanding infrastructure and preserving jobs domestically as ASML expands globally. This combination of technological leadership, prudent pricing, and strong governmental backing positions ASML as a vital, resilient player in the semiconductor supply chain, underpinning the future of advanced computing technologies.

Previously, we have covered ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML) in May 2025 wherein we summarized a bullish thesis by FluentInQuality on Substack. The author highlighted the company as the sole global provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, essential for producing the world’s most advanced semiconductors. It emphasized ASML’s unmatched technological moat, strong financials with high margins and return on invested capital, and significant geopolitical importance, positioning the company as a critical bottleneck in the semiconductor supply chain. Since our last coverage, the stock is up 10.96%.</p>

After a sharp but short-lived pullback last month, US equity markets, particularly tech and AI-related names, are charging higher once again. The AI bull run appears to be back on track.

Though artificial intelligence has been the dominant market theme for over two years, the pace of innovation shows no signs of slowing. In fact, it’s accelerating. Just last week, major tech players including Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia hosted developer conferences packed with headline-making announcements: Google unveiled cutting-edge video generation tools, Microsoft showcased AI-powered scientific breakthroughs, and Nvidia laid out its vision for “AI factories.”

With momentum returning and investor excitement reignited, I’ve been watching three standout stocks with both strong technical momentum setups and pivotal roles in the AI value chain: ASML Holding, Palantir Technologies and Broadcom.

ASML Holding is arguably the most critical company in the global semiconductor supply chain. Based in the Netherlands, ASML holds a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines—an essential technology for producing the most advanced chips used in AI, data centers, and high-performance computing. Without ASML’s machines, leading chipmakers like Nvidia, TSMC, and Intel wouldn’t be able to manufacture the cutting-edge semiconductors that power the AI revolution.

ASML currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting upward earnings estimate revisions, while analysts forecast EPS to grow an impressive 18.9% annually over the next three to five years. Despite its dominant market position and critical role in enabling AI hardware, the stock is trading at just 27x forward earnings, which is well below its 10-year median of 31.8x. This valuation discount offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors who believe in the continued expansion of AI and semiconductor demand.

Technically, ASML has been consolidating in a broad base since last fall, as investors accumulate shares. Today, the stock broke out of a bull flag and is approaching the broader base resistance at $780. So long as the stock holds above the $740 breakout level, momentum should carry it higher.

Broadcom has quietly become one of the most important players in the AI value chain. While best known for its dominance in semiconductors used in networking, broadband, and wireless infrastructure, Broadcom also designs custom chips for hyperscalers, including AI accelerators and ASICs used in large-scale data centers.</p>

To get a sense of who is truly in control of ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 50% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company&#39;s market cap fell to €261b last week after a 3.2% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 21% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market movers&#34;, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell ASML Holding, which might have negative implications on individual investors.

Let&#39;s delve deeper into each type of owner of ASML Holding, beginning with the chart below.

View our latest analysis for ASML Holding

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it&#39;s included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that ASML Holding does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company&#39;s stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of ASML Holding, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don&#39;t have a meaningful investment in ASML Holding. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 7.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 4.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 2.6% by the third-largest shareholder.</p>

Despite all the noise around tariffs between the U.S. and China, I think ASML&#39;s near-monopoly on EUV lithography and the AI boom are what really matterand those are the reasons why its massive order backlog stays intact. After looking through the company&#39;s Q1 2025 earnings presentation, I feel even more confident that ASML is set up for aggressive growth ahead, with some margin expansion potential too, which is a big reason why I think investors should stick with it. That being said, I do feel like sentiment around the stock has gotten a lot more negative lately, even though I personally think the actual story has improved. Shares dropped more than 5% after ASML announced Q1 results, mainly because net bookings (3.94 billion) came in lower than the 4.8 billion consensus and tariff fears popped back up again. But honestly, I think the tariff headlines are just noise at this pointASML is already working hard to de-risk its business away from China. And the way I see it, the order miss and cautious tone from management have now set a lower bar for the company going forward, which actually creates a better setup for long-term investors to get in at a cheaper price. In my view, expectations have gotten way too low here.

ASML is absolutely crucial to the global chip supply chain because they produce the specialized lithography machines needed to manufacture advanced semiconductors. In my view, that makes them basically irreplaceable, which is why I think there&#39;s a good shot the stock can re-rate to a much higher valuation when sentiment toward the sector improves.

Everyone&#39;s scrambling to get Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to make their chips, and that&#39;s pushing other companies to ramp up spending on lithography systems too, which is great news for ASML. According to Bloomberg, hyper scale companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are expected to spend around $371 billion on data centers and computing in 2025, a huge 44% YoY increase. Then in 2026, that figure is supposed to jump another 42% YoY to $525 billion. Since all that AI and data center buildout needs more complex chips, and nobody else can match ASML&#39;s EUV technology, I believe this puts them in a really strong spot. I&#39;m pretty confident that as global semiconductor sales pick up, especially fueled by generative AI, ASML&#39;s revenue growth will continue right alongside it.</p>

This outperformance raises the question: Should investors accumulate ASML shares or book profits and exit the investment?

ASML Holding’s recent rally stemmed from broader market optimism. Progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been boosting market sentiment since late April. Protracted trade tensions had previously dampened global economic forecasts and corporate earnings expectations due to tariffs and retaliatory measures.

Last week, the United States and China reached a deal to slash tariffs temporarily. The United States has agreed to lower its overall tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%. On the other hand, China will reduce duties on U.S. imports to 10% from 125%. The new adjustments will be effective for 90 days.

The recent trade deal suggests easing tensions between the two largest economies and smoother international trade flows. This improved outlook fostered investor confidence, leading to a rally in the equity market as fears of further economic disruption subsided and prospects for global growth seemed brighter.

Apart from ASML Holding, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including Lam Research LRCX, KLA Corporation KLAC and Applied Materials AMAT. Over the past month, shares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have soared 32.5%, 24% and 19.6%, respectively.

ASML Holding’s long-term growth potential and invigorated investor optimism make the stock worth buying.

ASML’s dominance in the semiconductor manufacturing sector is unchallenged. The company maintains a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is essential for producing advanced chips at 3nm and below. Its EUV systems are crucial for leading chipmakers such as TSMC, Samsung and Intel, positioning ASML as a key enabler of cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing.

ASML Holding’s High-NA EUV technology represents the next frontier in chip manufacturing. Designed for sub-2nm nodes, these advanced systems will be critical for the industry’s future. While the adoption of High-NA EUV has been slower than expected, the long-term potential remains enormous. As chipmakers ramp up production of smaller, more powerful chips, ASML’s High-NA EUV tools will play a pivotal role, driving sustained demand.</p>

Over the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +17.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&#39;s +12.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has gained 17.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock&#39;s future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually make its stock &#39;trending&#39; and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company&#39;s future earnings over anything else. That&#39;s because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors&#39; interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $5.80 per share, indicating a change of +34.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $27.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +30.5%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.62 indicates a change of +12.8% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock&#39;s price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p>

In an investor note, the analyst told investors that the company&#39;s Q1 results confirmed that the semi end-market dynamic was developing as expected, and artificial intelligence continued to be the main driver of semi end market demand.

Although ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) acknowledged the near-term tariff uncertainty, the company maintained its 2025 revenue guidance, and expects 2026 to be another growth year, added the advisory.

The company recently reiterated its 2025 revenue guidance of €30 billion to €35 billion, with a gross margin expectation of 51%-53%. The full-year growth is expected to be supported by Logic and Memory demand, with AI-related applications being a leading growth driver. Q2 guidance projects net sales between €7.2 billion and €7.7 billion and a gross margin of 50%-53%.

While we acknowledge the potential of ASML, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Cramer pointed out that markets often offer strong opportunities, especially on days when sentiment is low, and if investors remain too skeptical, they miss out. He emphasized that these chances do not appear in isolation; they show up often in what he called “the greatest market in the world.” As per Cramer, many stocks that were once dismissed or “left for dead” ended up rebounding. He noted, “The cynics missed all of these moves,” and went on to say, “You could have caught all of them.”

For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on May 15. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.8%

Owner of Ticketmaster and operator of music festival EDC, Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) is a company specializing in live event promotion, venue management, and ticketing services for concerts and shows.

Why Are We Wary of LYV?

Performance surrounding its events has lagged its peers

Operating margin of 4.1% falls short of the industry average, and the smaller profit dollars make it harder to react to unexpected market developments

Capital intensity will likely increase as its free cash flow margin is anticipated to drop by 1.9 percentage points over the next year

At $140.26 per share, Live Nation trades at 60.3x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with LYV, check out our full research report (it’s free).

Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 27.7%

Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.

Why Could QCOM Be a Winner?

Offerings and unique value proposition resonate with customers, as seen in its above-market 11.3% annual sales growth over the last five years

Robust free cash flow margin of 30.4% gives it many options for capital deployment

ROIC punches in at 52.2%, illustrating management’s expertise in identifying profitable investments

Qualcomm is trading at $157.17 per share, or 13.4x forward P/E. Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it’s free.

Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 24.1%

Founded in 2002 as a natural soda and juice company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is a pioneer of the energy drink category, and its Monster Energy brand targets a young, active demographic.

Why Will MNST Outperform?

Disciplined cost controls and effective management resulted in a strong two-year operating margin of 27.3%

MNST is a free cash flow machine with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives or return capital to shareholders, and its recently improved profitability means it has even more resources to invest or distribute

Stellar returns on capital showcase management’s ability to surface highly profitable business ventures</p>

Broadcom has become one of the leading players in the artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor market thanks to its expertise in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are custom processors designed for performing specific tasks.

The demand for these custom processors has been improving rapidly because of their ability to tackle AI workloads while keeping a handle on costs. As a result, several cloud hyperscalers are tapping Broadcom&#39;s custom chips and networking components to lower operating costs when running AI training and inference applications.

This explains why Broadcom&#39;s growth has been outstanding in recent quarters. Moreover, a massive addressable revenue opportunity in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion suggests that it is at the beginning of a solid growth curve. Not surprisingly, even Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) wants a piece of this lucrative opportunity, and it has just made a move that could help it make a dent in the custom AI chip market.

Qualcomm has just announced that it is set to acquire British chip company Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion with the aim to &#34;further accelerate, and provide key assets for, Qualcomm&#39;s expansion into data centers.&#34; Alphawave&#39;s technology will allow Qualcomm to integrate high-speed connectivity into its AI chip platforms to enable rapid data transfer, which will in turn lead to higher computing performance and reduced power consumption.

Qualcomm believes that Alphawave&#39;s &#34;products form a part of the core infrastructure enabling next generation services in a wide array of high growth applications, including data centers, AI, data networking and data storage.&#34; The chipmaker announced last month that it is set to reenter the data center market. The company is reportedly developing a custom AI chip platform using its Oryon central processing unit (CPU) and Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) processors, which it claims are capable enough to meet AI inferencing workloads in data centers.

The latest acquisition is another piece of the puzzle as Qualcomm gears up for the launch of a data center-focused chip platform. The company has already announced that it is partnering with Saudi Arabia-backed AI venture HUMAIN to build AI data centers in that country, suggesting that Qualcomm could get a foot in the door and eventually make its presence felt in the huge custom AI processor market.</p>

Still, that doesn’t stop me from seeing the stock as a long-term Buy—especially since my bullishness comes from Qualcomm’s key competitive advantage: its ability to build the Snapdragon platform, which integrates a modem, CPU, and even a GPU chip—something no other competitor can currently match. This positions the company to tap into new business opportunities that could help offset its current customer concentration.

Beyond that, Qualcomm’s asset-light model allows it to generate very high returns on its investments, highlighting its operational efficiency, strong financial health, and consistent value creation for shareholders. This helps justify the company trading at a slightly stretched valuation when considering its operational profits relative to enterprise value.

When looking for value stocks, one of the most important factors—if not the most important—is a company’s ability to generate consistent earnings. Examining QCOM’s balance sheet reveals a capital-light, high-margin model driven by intellectual property (IP) and characterized by heavy investment in research and development (R&amp;D).

As a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm relies on external manufacturing partners such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) for chip production. Notably, only approximately 7% of its $55.3 billion in total assets is allocated to property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E), which is relatively low compared to the industry average. This underscores the efficiency of its asset-light business model and the minimal physical infrastructure required to support its operations.

Roughly 18% of its assets are classified as goodwill, indicating a strong track record of acquisitions, which is clearly part of its strategy to acquire intellectual property (IP) or talent rather than build everything in-house. One recent example is the $2.4 billion acquisition of the UK-based semiconductor firm Alphawave.</p>

The companies revealed in a Monday statement that the offer is equivalent to about 183 pence per share for Alphawave, a 96% premium to the company’s share price on March 31. This was the last trading day prior to the companies disclosing the deal discussion. While the deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, it is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2026.

During the second quarter of 2025, the company reported staggering 59% year-over-year growth in this segment. It boasts a worldwide client base that includes leading automakers and technology companies like General Motors, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Renault Group, Royal Enfield, Volvo, Google and more. Over the past few years, Qualcomm has taken an approach of continuous innovation with strategic acquisitions to expand into the automotive market.

Since the acquisition of Veneer, Inc., the company has steadily gained a strong foothold in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology. The Arriver business of Veoneer operates the dedicated software unit focused on sensor perception and drive policy, including a full stack of features and functions. With this buyout, Qualcomm has integrated Arriver&#39;s Computer Vision, Drive Policy and Driver Assistance assets into its ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) portfolio. It has allowed QCOM to deliver an open and competitive platform for automakers to better compete with rivals within the self-driving vehicle market. The company recently acquired Autotalks, an industry leader in direct vehicle-to-everything communication technology. Integration of Autotalks’ robust portfolio of automotive-qualified global V2X solutions will facilitate the development of leading-edge, reliable solutions to enhance road safety and optimize traffic efficiency.

Growing demand for the company’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis product portfolio, which includes telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions, is expected to drive growth in automotive in the near term. In the second quarter, Qualcomm secured 30 new designs, including five ADAS programs and designs from Chinese automakers such as Nio, Zeekr, Great Wall, Dongfeng and more. Per our estimate, the company is expected to generate $3.7 billion in revenues from the automotive segment, indicating 27.3% year-over-year growth.

In the automotive segment, the company faces competition from the NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Intel Corporation INTC. 

NVIDIA DRIVE solutions include a comprehensive stack of hardware and software tools designed to support autonomous vehicles. It is also swiftly working on V2X technology, specifically in AI-driven connectivity for autonomous vehicles. With a vast client base that includes Mercedes-Benz, Li Auto, General Motors, Toyota and several other prominent automakers, NVIDIA has gained solid market traction in the AI-driven autonomous driving space.

Intel’s Mobileye has rapidly expanded in the autonomous car technology market. Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management are gaining popularity among automakers. More than 70 million vehicles from BMW, Volkswagen, Ford and Nissan use Intel’s Mobileye for driver assistance. However, with the integration of advanced V2X and a broader portfolio of digital cockpit, infotainment and connectivity, Qualcomm is expected to maintain its competitive edge in the automotive vertical.</p>

Semiconductor giant Qualcomm Inc. has agreed to buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion in an effort to better position itself for the artificial intelligence and data center boom.

The acquisition, expected to close during the first quarter of 2026, would provide San Diego-based Qualcomm with key assets from Alphawave, a U.K.-based chip designer focused on high-speed connectivity and compute silicon for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications.

The deal is part of a recent acquisition spree by Qualcomm to build out and enhance its product capabilities for the next generation of technologies.

In recent years, Qualcomm, a competitor with Intel, Apple and Nvidia, has been in growth mode to be part of the next wave of AI smartphones and expand into new markets.

In April, the company said it acquired the generative AI division of Vietnam-based company VinAI to improve research and development and accelerate the creation of advanced solutions for smartphones, PCs, vehicles and other products.

Qualcomm also recently purchased connected vehicle technology firm Autotalks to advance its smart mobility segment. Last year, Qualcomm added Foundries.io to its portfolio, expanding its internet-of-things capabilities.

Qualcomm, known for its Snapdragon processors used for gaming, cameras and audio, is also seeking to be a larger player in the expansion of AI-driven data centers.

The company’s next-generation processors Oryon CPU and Hexagon NPU are a “natural fit for data center workloads” and complementary to Alphawave’s high-speed technologies, Cristiano Amon, president and CEO of Qualcomm, said in a statement.

The pending deal is a milestone for Alphawave as it looks to expand its customer base, unlock growth opportunities and drive technological innovation.

Qualcomm primarily owns or leases manufacturing facilities across China, Germany and Singapore, according to its latest annual report dated Sept. 29, 2024. It also has sales, administrative and R&amp;D centers in the United States, India and China.

The company saw revenue grow 17% in the quarter ending in March to nearly $11 billion compared to last year. It also saw net income grow 21% to $2.8 billion as it navigated tariff headwinds.

Under the agreement, Alphawave shareholders can choose between 183 pence in cash or 0.01662 Qualcomm shares per Alphawave share. The transaction will be executed through a UK court-sanctioned scheme and is expected to close in Q1 2026.

The deal remains subject to regulatory approvals in the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Canada, as well as foreign direct investment clearance in the United Kingdom.

Alphawave&#39;s board called the offer a compelling value opportunity. As part of the deal preparation, Alphawave has divested its stake in Chinese joint venture WiseWave, easing potential regulatory hurdles. Jefferies analysts, who upgraded Alphawave to Buy in April, said the sale reduces geopolitical risk and improves the deal&#39;s odds.

On Monday, semiconductor company Alphawave recommended a $2.4bn (£1.8bn) sale to US chip giant Qualcomm while high-tech equipment maker Spectris urged shareholders to back a £4.4bn sale to private equity house Advent International.

The deals would mean both companies would cease to be listed in London, dealing a fresh blow to the City just days after Wise, the British financial technology champion, announced it was moving its main listing to New York.

Both takeovers will also see the American buyers pay substantially above the share prices that their British targets commanded beforehand, prompting suggestions they may have been undervalued by London investors.

Qualcomm’s offer is more than 90pc above Alphawave’s share price before talks began in April and the Spectris bid is 84pc higher than its stock price on Friday.

Charles Hall, head of research at Peel Hunt, said: “The bids for Spectris and Alphawave show how undervalued UK listed companies are given premiums of 85pc and 96pc respectively.”

“It continues the constant theme of companies leaving the market, with 30 takeovers of scale and just one initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 2025.”

“Urgent action is required if we want a healthy UK equity market that supports our listed companies and encourages the next generation of companies to list.”

Qualcomm said it was buying Alphawave to aid its expansion into data centres, which are becoming increasingly important in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) software.

Alphawave is a specialist in technologies that “drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption”, a joint statement by the companies said.

This means its products “form a part of the core infrastructure enabling next-generation services in a wide array of high growth applications, including data centres, AI, data networking and data storage”.

Silicon Valley giants such as OpenAI, Google and Amazon are racing to acquire more data centre capacity to help train their AI programmes.

Tony Pialis, the president and chief executive of Alphawave, said: “Together, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, drive innovation, and create a leading player in AI compute and connectivity solutions.

“For our shareholders, the Alphawave board is pleased that Qualcomm’s offer provides an opportunity to realise compelling value for their shares.”

Spectris, which is headquartered in London, makes various high tech instruments, including particle measuring systems used in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

Qualcomm has pioneered many different breakthroughs over the last four decades, but our mission remains the same: Bringing those innovations to as many people as possible.

From our original foundational work on cellular capabilities with CDMA technology to how we&#39;re positioning your favorite products to take advantage of the AI revolution, Qualcomm has - and continues to have - a major impact on your life.

Our drive to continuously innovate is marked by several critical missions we have embarked on over the last 40 years. A throughline of all those missions was to tap into technology to change the world.

And we&#39;ve changed the world. A lot.

As we celebrate our 40th anniversary, here are the five big missions we took on and the revolutions they sparked.

First mission: Mobility for all

Qualcomm&#39;s first ambition was to ensure everybody had a cellphone, which in 1985 was an alien concept.

That solution came in the form of CDMA, short for Code Division Multiple Access, a radio technology that allowed more simultaneous calls on the network. This opened the door to everyone potentially getting a phone.

CDMA was a foundational building block for 3G wireless service and has been one of the core concepts in mobile networking ever since, from 4G to our current 5G and the next iteration of cellular technology, 6G.

&#34;We saw early on that we had the ability to create technology, a technology called CDMA, that could make sure that everybody could have a phone with incredible quality and scale... that is how the company started, you know, the name of the company - Qualcomm - is quality communications. That&#39;s our very first mission,&#34; said Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon during his recent keynote appearance at SXSW, where he took a lap on the history and missions the company has executed in the last 40 years.

Second mission: More than phone calls

Modern smartphones are versatile, like Swiss Army Knives, capable of handling everything from shooting Hollywood-caliber films to paying for goods like a credit card or playing immersive mobile games.

But there was a time when your cellphone was just good for one thing: Making actual phone calls.

Qualcomm saw the potential for more, starting with the PDQ-800, the first &#34;smartphone&#34; that combined a cellphone with the open, application-friendly OS used by Palm Pilots.</p>

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM, also known as TSMC, is reinforcing its nanosheet chip technology roadmap with N2, N2P, and A16, which are aimed at extending performance and efficiency at advanced nodes. Out of these, the A16 advanced node has been specifically designed to accommodate high-performance computing (HPC) products and AI-class workloads. These advanced nodes are expected to extend TSMC’s technology leadership position and enable it to capture growth opportunities into the future.

Taiwan Semiconductor’s N2 logic node is the first generation of nanosheet transistor technology and offers 10-15% speed improvement, 25-30% power improvement, and more than 15% chip density gain when compared with N3E. The logic node is on track to enter volume production in the second half of 2025. Moreover, TSMC also expects the number of new tape-outs for N2, fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications, to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first two years.

Taiwan Semiconductor is winning important customers, such as AMD and Apple, for its new N2 advanced logic node. Apple plans to use these chips in future iPhones and Mac devices, while AMD wants to use them to make faster CPUs and GPUs to compete better in the market.

Introduced in the first quarter of 2025, N2P is an extension of the N2 family, which features improved performance and power efficiency. A16 is also a nanosheet-based technology with backside power delivery and is intended to be a logical upgrade to N2P. The A16 logic node, also introduced in the first quarter, is expected to deliver up to 15-20% power improvement and an additional 7-10% chip density gain when compared with N2P.

With fabs under construction in Taiwan and Arizona to support both N2 and A16 and volume production scheduled for N2P and A16 in the second half of 2025, Taiwan Semiconductor appears well-positioned to benefit from the next wave of AI and high-performance computing demand.

Two key competitors,  Intel INTC and GlobalFoundries GFS, are working hard to catch up with TSMC’s lead. Intel plans to launch its 2nm-based node, called Intel 18A, in the second half of 2025. Intel is focusing on new technologies like RibbonFET transistors and backside power delivery for its 18A node, similar to TSMC’s A16.

Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries is not focused on 2nm chips. Instead, it is investing in specialized chips for cars, wireless devices, and the IoTs. While GlobalFoundries does not directly compete with Taiwan Semiconductor at the most advanced nodes, it still aims to take market share in fast-growing chip segments.</p>

Intel Corp. extended its winning streak to a third straight day on Tuesday, adding 7.81 percent to close at $22.08 apiece as investors turned optimistic about the company’s turnaround plan.

Its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has been working on turning  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to profitability, with the company said to have stopped accepting new projects unless they can demonstrate a projected gross margin of at least 50 percent.

Under his watch, any product projected to generate less than 50 percent gross margin will not move forward or receive engineering resources.

Additionally, Tan is reportedly reviewing—and potentially cancelling or restructuring unprofitable deals with other companies.

Since heading Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) earlier this year, Tan immediately restructured the company’s workforce and leadership, continuing the layoff of 15,000 employees.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was reportedly looking to cut its workforce by 20 percent to reduce bureaucracy and refocus on engineering.

In the first quarter of the year, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) widened its attributable net loss by 115 percent to $821 million from the $381 million in the same period last year. Net revenues were flat at $12.7 billion.

Overall, INTC ranks 3rd on our list of top-performing companies on Tuesday. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?

NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire

The new installments in AMD’s MI350 chip series are faster than Nvidia counterparts and represent major gains over earlier versions, Su said at a company event Thursday in San Jose, California. The MI355 chips, which started shipping earlier this month, are 35 times faster than predecessors, she said.

Though AMD remains a distant second to Nvidia in AI accelerators — the chips that help develop and run artificial intelligence tools — it aims to start catching up with these new products. The stakes are higher than ever: Su previously predicted $500 billion in market revenue by 2028, but she now sees it topping that number.

“People used to think that $500 billion was very large number,” she said in a briefing following her presentation. “Now it seems well within grasp.”

In February, AMD gave a forecast for its data center business that reflected slower growth than some analysts predicted. AMD believes the new update to its MI range will restore momentum and prove it can go toe to toe with a much bigger rival.

AMD said that the MI355 outperforms Nvidia’s B200 and GB200 products when it comes to running AI software and equals or exceeds them when creating the code. Purchasers will pay significantly less than they would versus Nvidia, AMD said.

A representative for Nvidia didn’t have an immediate comment.

Investors gave a tepid response to AMD’s latest presentation, with the shares falling 2.2% to $118.50 at the close Thursday in New York. That wiped out the small gains that the stock made this year.

Nvidia and AMD are the leading providers of advanced computer graphics chips, which became the basis of components for developing AI. Demand has consistently outstripped supply as some of the world’s largest companies have poured tens of billions of dollars into new infrastructure. That’s forced up the price of chips, which can cost multiple tens of thousands of dollars each.

For AMD, the accelerator business has helped it escape the shadow of Intel Corp., its longtime rival in personal computer processors. But Nvidia has eclipsed them both. While AMD is getting multiple billions of dollars from its AI accelerators, Nvidia is generating more than $100 billion a year.</p>

The new Intel Xeon 6 processors with Performance-cores are engineered to support the huge demand for high AI workloads across diverse sectors. The solution’s built-in accelerators support virtualized radio access networks, media, AI and network security. This matches the growing demand for network and edge solutions in the AI ecosystem. 

The company also integrated Priority Core Turbo (“PCT”) technology and Intel Speed Select Technology – Turbo Frequency (SST-TF). The technology dynamically prioritizes certain performance cores, allowing them to run at higher turbo frequencies, and in parallel, lower priority cores operate at a base frequency. PCT paired with SST-TF optimizes utilization of CPU resources, enhancing performance of graphical processing units for the most demanding AI workloads.

The processor offers significantly faster memory performance at high-capacity configurations compared with its competitor Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD EPYC processor. Up to 128 P-cores per CPU facilitate a balanced workload distribution for AI tasks. With the most efficient data processing and transfer capabilities, these CPUs are built for maximum uptime with unmatched reliability and serviceability.

This cutting-edge feature suite is giving Intel a competitive edge over its competitors, such as AMD. The growing demand for processors based on Arm Holdings ARM architecture is also intensifying the competition. Arm’s architecture offers energy efficiency with cost effectiveness, which is increasingly used by Apple, Qualcomm and Ampere. The company is actively collaborating with developers to optimize AI-ML workloads in its CPUs. Google Cloud also leveraged Arm-based processors for Axion chips for data centers. 

On the other hand, AMD EPYC 9005 series, engineered with very high core counts, is also gaining solid momentum. The company’s partnership with leading hyperscalers such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud is driving demand for AMD EYPC CPUs.

Amid such competition, Intel is taking several initiatives to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector, which spans cloud and enterprise servers, networks, volume clients and ubiquitous edge environments, in tune with the evolving market dynamics. Introduction of cutting-edge features in the Intel Xeon 6 processors in recent months is aligned with that broader strategy. 

Intel Xeon 6 has been selected as the host CPU for NVIDIA’s latest generation of AI-accelerated systems, the DGX B300. The endorsement of NVIDIA accentuates the growing prowess of Intel chips for AI-accelerated systems. Recently, Imperial College London selected Intel XEON 6 to power its new HX2 supercomputer. Intel CPU will support high-performance computing and AI requirements for research in a wide range of fields, including engineering, natural sciences, medicine, business and others.</p>

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Intel Corp. INTC, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.&#39;s AMD.

Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:

Intel Corp. stock plunged 70% post chip foundry venture, yet Lip-Bu Tan&#39;s appointment as new CEO and recent 10% stock rise hint at a potential turnaround. Is it a good buy now? Let&#39;s see.

Both Intel and NVIDIA Corp. produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA&#39;s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA&#39;s Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?).

Of course, it&#39;s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA&#39;s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel&#39;s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA&#39;s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips.

In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel&#39;s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., or TSMC, and Samsung.

However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel&#39;s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions.

Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.&#39;s $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback.</p>

Once upon a time, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was a millionaire-maker stock. If you had invested $10,000 in its initial public offering (IPO) in 1971, it would be worth $10.3 million today. However, that investment briefly blossomed to $37.9 million when the stock closed at its record high on Aug. 28, 2000.

Yet Intel hasn&#39;t generated any millionaire-making gains since then. Over the past decade, the chipmaker struggled with market share losses to AMD in the x86 CPU market, persistent shortages and delays, and abrupt strategic shifts under four different CEOs. It couldn&#39;t leverage its dominance of the PC and server CPU markets to expand into the higher-growth mobile and AI chip markets, while its own foundries fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC for short) in the race to produce smaller and denser chips.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Intel&#39;s revenue to have an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% as the company&#39;s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, tries to bolster its engineering capabilities, develop more CPUs with integrated AI features, strengthen the foundry business, and streamline spending.

Analysts expect Intel to stay unprofitable in 2025 as it spins all those plates, but they expect it to turn profitable again in 2026 and grow its net income more than sevenfold in 2027.

That&#39;s an optimistic outlook, but Intel could struggle to balance the rollout of its latest 18A chips with its cost-cutting -- which includes the divestments of its noncore assets, layoffs, and its dependence on TSMC to manufacture some of its new 2nm CPUs.

The stock also still looks overvalued relative to its peers at 74 times its forward adjusted earnings. So instead of betting on Intel&#39;s eventual recovery, it might be smarter to stick with another millionaire-maker semiconductor stock with a brighter future: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).

Avago Technologies, the chipmaker that acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, went public in 2009 at a split-adjusted price of $1.50 per share. A $10,000 investment in that IPO would be worth $1.63 million today.

Prior to acquiring Broadcom, Avago produced a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio frequency chips. The original Broadcom competed against Avago in the storage and networking markets, but it also sold a wider variety of mobile, multimedia, and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips. By combining those two businesses, the &#34;new&#34; Broadcom supplied a diverse mix of essential chips for its enterprise, industrial, and mobile customers.</p>

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock saw a day of big sell-offs in Wednesday&#39;s daily session. The chip company&#39;s share price closed out the day down 6.3% due to concerns that competitive pressures are mounting.

Intel&#39;s valuation sank today following news about a product that Nvidia is readying that could compete with Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) space. Meanwhile, another report suggested that Advanced Micro Devices will continue gaining market share from Intel in the server CPU market.

According to recent leaks, Nvidia is gearing up to launch two accelerated processing unites (APUs) for the consumer market that would combine a CPU and a graphics processing unit (GPU) into single products. Based on some limited perimeters, some leaked benchmark scores for the more advanced of Nvidia&#39;s rumored APUs point to performance that tops a comparable offering from Intel. Real-world performance may be more favorable in Intel in many situations, but moves from Nvidia to play a bigger role in the CPU space could still create significant competitive pressures.

Making matters worse, a new report from Mercury Research suggests that AMD has continued to rapidly increase its market share in the server CPU space. According to Mercury&#39;s report, AMD managed to capture 40% of the CPU market for servers in this year&#39;s first quarter -- and it&#39;s poised to match Intel in market share sometime next year.

Intel&#39;s path forward looks complicated. The company has missed out on the early growth market for artificial intelligence (AI) GPUs, and it&#39;s facing pressure in both the consumer and enterprise CPU markets. While the company&#39;s chip foundry unit has the potential to be an important national resource for the U.S., it remains to be seen whether its next-gen semiconductor fabrication platform will actually attract substantial interest from third parties seeking manufacturing services for their AI chip designs.

Intel stock could surge if there are signs that its turnaround strategy is yielding results, but there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty on the table right now.

Both Intel and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA’s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA&#39;s Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?).

Of course, it’s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA’s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel’s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA’s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips.

In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel’s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, or TSMC, and Samsung.

However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel’s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions.

Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback.

Last but not least, Lip-Bu Tan’s appointment as the CEO of Intel has been well-received by market pundits, as his stint in the semiconductor industry has been productive. Tan’s initiatives to streamline operations, deliver a competitive AI platform, and spin-off assets would restore stability at Intel and help the company return to its past glory. 

With Lip-Bu Tan leading Intel’s foundry recovery and AI accelerators gaining ground among competitors through cost advantages, holding onto INTC stock seems judicious. Intel’s business revival is becoming more probable, and brokers are showing optimism by increasing the short-term price target for INTC to $22.42 (up 9.5%) from $20.48. The highest target is $62, indicating a potential 202.7% upside.</p>

“Europe has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories,” said Huang, whose company is supplying chips for virtually every major AI-computing project. Several of massive data centers will have more than a gigawatt of capacity, potentially ranking them among the largest in the world, he said during a company event jointly held with the VivaTech tech conference in Paris.

“The researchers, the startups, your AI shortage, your GPU shortage will be resolved for you soon,” he said. “It’s coming.”

Europe lags behind the US in developing the infrastructure for AI and hasn’t matched the spending committed by other regions. Huang said at an event in London on Monday with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that a lack of infrastructure was holding back growth in a country that otherwise had the expertise and startups to be a global competitor in AI. His visits to London and Paris are part of a globe-trotting campaign to promote the adoption of AI and his company’s products.

Huang didn’t say how much he thought the planned AI factories in Europe would ultimately cost. He estimated later in his speech that a single one could cost as much as $50 billion.

In February, the European Union announced a new €20 billion ($23 billion) fund for five AI gigafactories dedicated to development and training of next-generation AI models, each with over 100,000 processors.

While in Paris, Huang announced a raft of projects aimed at bolstering AI infrastructure across Europe. Nvidia is teaming up with Mistral AI to use local computing to run the startup’s services. “We’re going to build an AI cloud together,” Huang said.

An offering called Mistral Compute will tap 18,000 new Grace Blackwell chips from Nvidia. It will be developed in Mistral’s data center in Essonne, France, and the company plans to roll it out to other locations in Europe.

French President Emmanuel Macron cheered the tie-up between the two firms, asking French and European companies to use the new AI computing offering. “I want to encourage all the large companies and startups to join this team,” Macron said at an event, making it part of a “fight for sovereignty and strategic autonomy.”</p>

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMD.

Management offered upbeat guidance for the next quarter despite lingering macro challenges, including shifting tariffs and trade tensions. The Data Center unit, crucial to AMD&#39;s valuation, could exceed $20 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, driven largely by AI chip sales.

At its 2021 peak, AMD shares traded above $150; they&#39;re near $123 now, having climbed about 2% year to date. While AMD remains second to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in AI processors, expanding AI revenue share may boost margins and sentiment. New chip launches continue to draw positive third-party reviews.

Analysts project AI chip sales could hit $13$15 billion in 2025, supported by large deals such as a reported $10 billion agreement with a Saudi AI startup. AMD&#39;s pricing edge and diversified customers may help narrow the gap with NVDA&#39;s leading offerings.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a competitor in CPUs, but AMD&#39;s growing server market share underpins a higher valuation multiple. The company also unveiled an additional $6 billion share buyback, bringing total authorization to $10 billion. That may support the stock if AI-driven growth persists amid macro uncertainties.

Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Advanced Micro Devices Inc is $129.18 with a high estimate of $200.00 and a low estimate of $95.00. The average target implies a upside of +4.82% from the current price of $123.24.

These rules block shipments of its H20 AI chips to China. This will have a big impact on NVIDIA’s second-quarter revenue growth. The company’s projection of $45 billion for second-quarter revenue represents 2% sequential growth, the slowest in the past nine quarters.

The H20 was made specifically for the Chinese market, and now NVIDIA can’t ship it. As a result, the company had to write down $4.5 billion in unsold inventory and future chip orders. This shows how much NVIDIA depended on China for sales.

There is another risk of losing one of the largest markets for AI chips. If NVIDIA can’t access the Chinese market, its growth may slow down. On the first-quarter earnings call, the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, warned that these export controls could help China’s local chipmakers catch up faster.

To counter revenue losses from export restrictions to the Chinese market, NVIDIA is trying to grow in other regions. It is focusing on AI infrastructure deals in places like Saudi Arabia and the European Union. The company is also working with U.S. partners to build chips locally. However, none of these markets can fully replace China’s size and speed of growth.

In simple terms, NVIDIA is facing real risks from the ongoing trade tensions. The company still has strong products and demand in other regions, but being cut off from China could limit how fast it can grow in the future.

While NVIDIA is taking the biggest hit, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC are also facing challenges from the U.S. government’s AI chip export restrictions to China.

Advanced Micro Devices was banned from exporting its MI308 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, which compete directly with NVIDIA’s data center GPUs. AMD had earlier stated that this export restriction would cost it around $800 million. China is a key growth market for AI accelerators, and missing out could limit Advanced Micro Devices’ opportunity to scale this business line.

Intel faces similar problems with its Gaudi 3 chips. The company has positioned Gaudi as a cost-effective AI solution, and China was expected to be part of its expansion strategy. However, with exports now restricted, Intel could struggle to hit volume targets, adding pressure to its already tight margins and turnaround efforts.

Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 7.1% year to date against the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 6%.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip and related technology space, seems poised to increase its acquisition activity in the near-term to medium-term.

Nvidia has proven very savvy in making prior acquisitions. Notably, its largest acquisition ever -- its $6.9 billion purchase of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020 -- has proven to be a huge winner. So, investors should be able to count on future acquisitions also being shrewd and helping to boost Nvidia&#39;s profit growth and, hence, its stock price.

Two main reasons for my prediction are statements that CFO Colette Kress made last December and my periodic reviews of Nvidia&#39;s job ads, which suggest the company is beefing up its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) capabilities.

Moreover, it just makes sense that the company will ramp up its acquisition activity because it has a ton of cash. Sure, it&#39;s generating interest income, but some of that cash should be able to be put to better use.

In addition, Nvidia&#39;s top management team and its board of directors know that smart acquisitions can help drive profit growth, which should drive stock price growth. And these folks surely want the stock&#39;s good times to continue as they all have very sizable to massive wealth tied to Nvidia stock.

For instance, CEO Jensen Huang, longtime board member Cox Tench, and CFO Kress&#39;s Nvidia stock holdings were worth more than $122 billion, $3.5 billion, and $792 million, respectively, as of the market close on Monday, June 9.

&#34;We can also think about that in terms of our work, of bringing on great teams in some M&amp;A [merger and acquisition] form... That is a great opportunity for us to do,&#34; Tom&#39;s Hardware reported Kress as saying at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference in December.

Forward P/E Ratio: 36.8x

Inventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.

Why Do We Steer Clear of INTC?

Customers postponed purchases of its products and services this cycle as its revenue declined by 6.9% annually over the last five years

Overall productivity fell over the last five years as its plummeting sales were accompanied by a decline in its operating margin

Free cash flow margin shrank by 25 percentage points over the last five years, suggesting the company is consuming more capital to stay competitive

At $22.10 per share, Intel trades at 36.8x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why INTC doesn’t pass our bar.

Sales are projected to tank by 6.4% over the next 12 months as its demand continues evaporating

Waning returns on capital imply its previous profit engines are losing steam

Nike is trading at $63.99 per share, or 31.6x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including NKE in your portfolio, it’s free.

Incremental sales over the last two years have been highly profitable as its earnings per share increased by 53.3% annually, topping its revenue gains

Industry-leading 22.9% return on capital demonstrates management’s skill in finding high-return investments, and its returns are climbing as it finds even more attractive growth opportunities</p>

Intel shares soared on Tuesday, pacing gains on the S&amp;P 500, as chip stocks rallied amid hopes that curbs on exports to China could be eased.

The stock recently found buying interest around the lower levels of a multi-month trading range, with the price closing above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages on Tuesday.

Investors should watch crucial overhead areas on Intel&#39;s chart around $23, $26 and $33, while also monitoring a major support level near $19.



Intel (INTC) shares soared on Tuesday, pacing gains on the S&amp;P 500, as chip stocks rallied amid hopes that curbs on exports to China could be eased.

The gains for chip stocks—the PHLX Semiconductor Index has risen 2% in each of the past two sessions—come as the U.S. and China hold trade talks this week in London, where officials are reportedly discussing restrictions on exports of various products, including rare earth minerals and chips.

Intel shares gained nearly 8% on Tuesday, closing at just above $22. The stock is up about 10% so far in 2025, outpacing the gains of the S&amp;P 500, but has lost nearly 30% of its value over the past 12 months amid uncertainty over the chipmaker’s strategic direction and inability to capitalize on the booming AI chip market. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over the top spot in mid-March, has launched a major restructuring effort.

Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s price and use technical analysis to identify crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching.

Intel shares have remained rangebound since gapping sharply lower last August. More recently, the stock found buying interest around the lower levels of the trading range, with the price closing above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages on Tuesday.

Importantly, the move higher occurred on the highest daily volume since early April, indicating buying conviction from larger market participants. Moreover, the rally thrust the relative strength index back above its neutral threshold to signal accelerating price momentum.

Let’s identify three crucial overhead areas to watch if the stock continues to trend higher and also locate a major support level worth monitoring during pullbacks.

It’s initially worth watching the $23 level. This area on the chart may attract selling interest near last month’s swing high during an attempt to reclaim the 200-day MA.

Buying above this level could see the shares rally toward $26. Tactical traders who employ rangebound strategies may seek exit points in this area near three prominent peaks that formed on the chart between November and March, a location that also marks the top of the stock’s multi-month trading range.</p>

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC.

Tan has already moved to trim headcount, flatten bureaucracy and refocus on core engineering strengths. He&#39;s said Intel must shed non-core assets and sharpen its customer focus, steps likely to improve operating metrics over time.

On the AI front, Tan has launched initiatives for AI-optimized hardware and software, backed by new Chief Technology and AI Officer Sachin Katti. Longer term, Intel&#39;s existing efforts in quantum computing, like its 12-qubit Tunnel Falls chip, may benefit as larger players such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) seek reliable foundry partners.

Intel also stands to gain from U.S. onshoring trends under the current administration. Meanwhile, the emerging humanoid robot market, projected by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) to reach $38 billion by 2035, could offer additional upside if Intel&#39;s processors and RealSense depth cameras become standard brains for new robotic systems.

Tan&#39;s challenge is steep, but his track record suggests Intel may find a path back toward growth and greater investor confidence.

AMD’s Data Center segment is emerging as the company’s growth engine—and for good reason. In Q1, the segment generated $3.7 billion in revenue, marking a 57% year-over-year increase, fueled by surging demand for its EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs. CEO Lisa Su pointed to deepening partnerships with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL), as hyperscalers increasingly rely on AMD’s chips to power AI workloads.

This momentum isn’t just a one-off. Data center revenue nearly doubled in 2024 to $12.6 billion, and Q1’s results continue that trajectory. AMD is further reinforcing its position through strategic acquisitions, such as Untether AI and Brium, thereby expanding its capabilities in both AI hardware and software. The upcoming Instinct MI350 series is already generating buzz for its potential to rival Nvidia in AI infrastructure.

Despite the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, AMD’s consistent data center growth, driven by rising AI demand and a strengthened ecosystem, suggests the company is well-positioned for a robust and sustained run.

AMD’s Client segment shouldn’t be overlooked—it’s staging an impressive comeback. In Q1, client revenue surged to $2.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of the new “Zen 5” Ryzen processors across both laptops and desktops. AMD’s Ryzen AI Max chips are at the forefront of this growth, powering over 50 AI-enabled laptop models expected to hit the market this year. But beyond the spike in sales, this signals AMD’s growing presence in the PC space, particularly in AI-driven devices like Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs—a trend that could create lasting tailwinds.

What’s particularly compelling is the shift in market perception. Once seen as the underdog, AMD is now steadily gaining ground on Intel by delivering processors that excel in both performance and power efficiency. The Client segment’s 68% jump in Q1 reflects this evolution—AMD is no longer catching up; it’s setting the pace. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into everyday computing, Ryzen chips are well-positioned to keep driving growth in this segment.</p>

Over the longer term, AMD shares have shown robust performance, posting a total return of 119.28% over the past five years. In contrast, within the past year, AMD&#39;s share movement was less favorable, underperforming compared to the broader US semiconductor industry, which saw a return of 6.1%.

The recent news may positively influence AMD&#39;s revenue and earnings forecasts by enhancing its market positioning and competitive edge, potentially mitigating some of the concerns about future market restrictions and margin pressures. Despite a current share price of US$98.62, which reflects a solid quarterly gain, it remains priced below the consensus analyst price target of approximately US$128.76, indicating potential market optimism regarding its growth prospects. However, analysts&#39; views on AMD&#39;s valuation differ, with some cautioning that market expectations might be elevated compared to more conservative projections.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMD.

Analyst Joseph Moore kept his Equal-Weight rating and $121 price target, noting that while the MI350 launch hit expectations, the focus remains on the rack-scale MI400/450 product for next year, which could provide the bigger inflectionif they can deliver.

The event featured customer testimonials from Meta, Oracle, OpenAI, Microsoft, Cohere and HUMAIN that were constructive but not thesis changing, Moore said. AMD also highlighted its rack-scale architecture and gave a sneak peek at the MI400 series, which early indications suggest could match Nvidia&#39;s forthcoming Vera Rubin GPUs in performance.

However, Moore warns that near-term upside remains modest until MI400 proves itself: AI upside is considerable longer term but near-term products don&#39;t support high convictionMI400 may change the stakes, but is still something of a show-me story.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman&#39;s onstage appearance added credibility to AMD&#39;s tens of billions revenue forecast for AI, Moore noted, even though no surprise customer deals were announced.

The company underscored its aggressive M&amp;A strategy25 acquisitions and investments over the past yearas evidence of its resourcefulness in chasing market share against much larger rivals.

Why It Matters: With the AI accelerator market dominated by Nvidia, MI400&#39;s successful delivery could be the catalyst AMD needs to boost its data-center compute share and validate lofty long-term growth projections.

Closing: Investors will look for early technical benchmarks and customer commitments around MI400likely unveiled in detail at next year&#39;s Computex eventto gauge whether AMD can ignite its next AI growth phase.

AMD shares have lost 3.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 2.5% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 16.4%.

The underperformance can be attributed to increasing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty, which are attributed to higher tariffs.  Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.

However, AMD is benefiting from its expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base.

AMD is strengthening its footprint in the artificial intelligence (AI) market through an expanding portfolio. AMD recently introduced its comprehensive, end-to-end AI platform at the 2025 Advancing AI event, introducing the powerful Instinct MI350 Series GPUs with 4x generational AI compute gains. 

The company also showcased its open, rack-scale AI infrastructure and ROCm 7 software stack, enabling scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment. Strategic partners like Meta Platforms META, OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, and Oracle ORCL highlighted AMD’s growing role in powering next-gen AI workloads.

Meta Platforms announced the broad deployment of AMD Instinct MI300X for Llama 3 and Llama 4 inference. Meta Platforms also expressed strong interest in the MI350 Series and is collaborating with AMD on future AI roadmaps, including the MI400 platform.

Microsoft also announced that AMD Instinct MI300X is powering both proprietary and open-source models in production on Microsoft Azure. The collaboration with Microsoft supports scalable AI workloads across the cloud.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is among the first to adopt AMD’s open rack-scale AI infrastructure featuring the MI355X GPUs. Oracle is also building zettascale AI clusters using up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs to support large-scale AI workloads.

AMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. The company’s strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.

EPYC processors are now deployed by all top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor companies. These processors are also gaining momentum in automotive, manufacturing, and energy sectors.</p>

Bernstein described the event as “not bad but no huge surprises,” noting that while AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) provided new details on its GPU roadmap, including the MI350 (in production, available Q3), MI400 (2026), and MI500 (2027), “there were no new major GPU partners announced.”

The firm stated that the MI350 finally closes the raw performance gap with NVIDIA’s Blackwell, “albeit about a year late,” while the MI450 “should be closer to Rubin than AMD’s prior efforts,” assuming a smooth launch.

Bernstein also said that AMD’s “management [is] incrementally more bullish on the long term,” lifting its 2028 AI accelerator TAM view to “more than $500B.”

However, AMD didn’t provide updated near-term revenue guidance. The firm added, “Right now we would still rather own NVDA.”

Morgan Stanley called the MI350 “evolutionary” and emphasized that the “focus remains on the rack scale MI400/450 product for next year, which could provide the bigger inflection — if they can deliver.”

Analysts also noted that “commentary was positive but not thesis changing,” with most customer enthusiasm still centered on earlier products or the upcoming MI400 series.

Morgan Stanley also highlighted that “AMD may not grow that much across their largest customers for MI350 series even off the much lower base,” suggesting possible share loss even as inference demand soars.

Despite gaining a foothold with major AI players, “MI400 may change the stakes, but is still something of a show-me story,” concluded the bank.

Both firms maintained neutral ratings on the stock.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.

Speaking at the Advancing AI 2025 conference in San Jose, Su highlighted an explosion of models tailored to coding, healthcare and finance, and forecast that hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of purpose-built models will drive massive GPU usage.

She reminded the audience that last year AMD projected the data-center AI accelerator total addressable market would expand over 60% annually to $500 billion by 2028and now sees that number trending even higher as inference takes off.

Su used the stage to unveil the MI350 GPU series, including the flagship MI355, which delivers a 35 performance leap over its predecessor and 40% more tokens per dollar versus Nvidia&#39;s (NASDAQ:NVDA) B200 when running LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 and Llama 3.3. Customers such as Meta (NASDAQ:META), xAI and Microsoft are already preparing upgrades from MI300 to MI350, highlighting growing commercial traction.

Su also touted AMD&#39;s record 40% share of the AI-accelerator market, powering the world&#39;s two fastest supercomputers and serving seven of the top ten model providers with its Instinct chips. Eric Boyd, Microsoft&#39;s AI-platform VP, reinforced the momentum, praising AMD&#39;s high-capacity memory per chip as a significant advantage for LLM workloads.

Why It Matters: With inferencing now the largest driver of AI compute, AMD&#39;s optimistic growth outlook and new hardware could translate into accelerated revenue and margin expansion as enterprises race to deploy ever more specialized AI models.

Here&#39;s what investors need to know today.

U.S. stock futures are falling and oil prices are spiking Friday as Israel&#39;s attacks on Iran&#39;s nuclear program and military leadership are sparking worries of a broader Middle East conflict and are driving investors into safe-haven assets. Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq futures are 1% lower, and S&amp;P 500 futures are down 1.2%. Oil prices are jumping more than 8%. Gold is rising roughly 1% to around $3,433 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury yield is little changed at 4.37%. The U.S. dollar, which hit a three-year-low Thursday, is gaining ground against the euro, pound, and yen. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is falling almost 2% to trade below $105,000.

Adobe (ADBE) delivered better-than-estimated fiscal second-quarter results on record-high sales and raised its full-year revenue and profit projections. However, the Creative Cloud developer&#39;s shares are slipping more than 3% in premarket trading, and Citi analysts called the results &#34;fairly straight down the middle&#34; and noted that &#34;overall AI usage appears to be leveling off.&#34;

June consumer sentiment data is due at 10:00 a.m. ET today, and analysts expect an improvement from May&#39;s reading, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs will be a key topic in the report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment is expected to show a preliminary reading of 54.0, an improvement from the May reading of 52.2.

Oracle (ORCL) shares are pulling back slightly in premarket trading after soaring 13% to an all-time high Thursday, a day after the company&#39;s fiscal fourth-quarter results and sales outlook sailed past Wall Street expectations. The enterprise software giant said it expects &#34;dramatically higher&#34; revenue growth this fiscal year, driven by strength in its cloud infrastructure segment, a bullish projection that prompted analysts to increase price targets.</p>

SAN JOSE (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices has forged close ties to a batch of artificial intelligence startups as part of the company&#39;s effort to bolster its software and forge superior chip designs.

As AI companies seek alternatives to Nvidia&#39;s chips, AMD has begun to expand its plans to build a viable competing line of hardware, acquiring companies such as server maker ZT Systems in its quest to achieve that goal.

But to build a successful line of chips also requires a powerful set of software to efficiently run the programs built by AI developers. AMD has acquired several small software companies in recent weeks in a bid to boost its talent, and it has been working to beef up its set of software, broadly known as ROCm.

&#34;This will be a very thoughtful, deliberate, multi-generational journey for us,&#34; said Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AI at AMD.

AMD has committed to improve its ROCm and other software, which is a boon to customers such as AI enterprise startup Cohere, as it results in speedy changes and the addition of new features.

Cohere is focused on building AI models that are tailored for large businesses versus the foundational AI models that companies like OpenAI and others target.

AMD has made important strides in improving its software, Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez said in an interview with Reuters. Changing Cohere&#39;s software to run on AMD chips was a process that previously took weeks and now happens in only &#34;days,&#34; Gomez said.

Gomez declined to disclose exactly how much of Cohere&#39;s software relies on AMD chips but called it a &#34;meaningful segment of our compute base&#34; around the world.

OPENAI INFLUENCE

OpenAI has had significant influence on the design of the forthcoming MI450 series of AI chips, said Forrest Norrod, an executive vice president at AMD.

AMD&#39;s MI400 series of chips will be the basis for a new server called &#34;Helios&#34; that the company plans to release next year. Nvidia too has engineered whole servers in part because AI computations require hundreds or thousands of chips strung together.

OpenAI&#39;s Sam Altman appeared on stage at AMD&#39;s Thursday event in San Jose, and discussed the partnership between the two companies in broad terms.

Norrod said that OpenAI&#39;s requests had a big influence on how AMD designed the MI450 series memory architecture and how the hardware can scale up to thousands of chips necessary to build and run AI applications.

The ChatGPT creator also influenced what kinds of mathematical operations the chips are optimized for.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the world we live in. With the technology perhaps being a once-in-a-generation opportunity, it&#39;s not too late to invest in the stocks leading the AI charge.

Let&#39;s look at five leading AI stocks to buy right now.

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI by helping organizations actually put AI to work.

By gathering data and structuring it into an &#34;ontology,&#34; Palantir&#39;s AI platform (AIP) maps digital assets to real-world objects and processes to let customers apply AI to solve real-world problems. AIP is being used for a variety of tasks, from optimizing supply chains to automating underwriting to even monitoring for sepsis in hospitals.

While the company has long been an important government vendor, Palantir&#39;s growth is currently being powered by the U.S. public sector. Given the wide array of applications across industries that AIP can be used for, Palantir has a massive opportunity in front of it.

Recently, Palantir has introduced AI agents within AIP that go beyond analysis to take action. Agentic AI is becoming the next big AI push, and could be a big growth driver for the company.

That said, the stock isn&#39;t cheap, and government budget cuts could potentially impact growth. Still, Palantir&#39;s technology looks unmatched, and the company is well-positioned to be a long-term AI leader.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to be one of the top ways to invest in the AI infrastructure boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of AI data centers thanks to their powerful parallel processing capabilities. And as the engine that helps run AI workloads, demand for GPUs continues to soar as organizations race to build and run AI models and apps.

Nvidia&#39;s real moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform, which it created to make it easier for developers to program its chips. Since then, it has built a powerful suite of tools and libraries that further enhance its GPUs&#39; performance for AI workloads.

The tight integration between its powerful GPUs and CUDA helped Nvidia attain an over 90% share in the GPU market in Q1. Its new Blackwell chips are ramping up faster than any product in its history, and demand for its full-stack AI &#34;factories&#34; continues to surge. Beyond the data center, Nvidia is also gaining traction in the automotive space, with revenue expected to hit $5 billion this year.</p>

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?

NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire

The new installments in AMD’s MI350 chip series are faster than Nvidia counterparts and represent major gains over earlier versions, Su said at a company event Thursday in San Jose, California. The MI355 chips, which started shipping earlier this month, are 35 times faster than predecessors, she said.

Though AMD remains a distant second to Nvidia in AI accelerators — the chips that help develop and run artificial intelligence tools — it aims to start catching up with these new products. The stakes are higher than ever: Su previously predicted $500 billion in market revenue by 2028, but she now sees it topping that number.

“People used to think that $500 billion was very large number,” she said in a briefing following her presentation. “Now it seems well within grasp.”

In February, AMD gave a forecast for its data center business that reflected slower growth than some analysts predicted. AMD believes the new update to its MI range will restore momentum and prove it can go toe to toe with a much bigger rival.

AMD said that the MI355 outperforms Nvidia’s B200 and GB200 products when it comes to running AI software and equals or exceeds them when creating the code. Purchasers will pay significantly less than they would versus Nvidia, AMD said.

A representative for Nvidia didn’t have an immediate comment.

Investors gave a tepid response to AMD’s latest presentation, with the shares falling 2.2% to $118.50 at the close Thursday in New York. That wiped out the small gains that the stock made this year.

Nvidia and AMD are the leading providers of advanced computer graphics chips, which became the basis of components for developing AI. Demand has consistently outstripped supply as some of the world’s largest companies have poured tens of billions of dollars into new infrastructure. That’s forced up the price of chips, which can cost multiple tens of thousands of dollars each.

For AMD, the accelerator business has helped it escape the shadow of Intel Corp., its longtime rival in personal computer processors. But Nvidia has eclipsed them both. While AMD is getting multiple billions of dollars from its AI accelerators, Nvidia is generating more than $100 billion a year.</p>

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MU.

The company will spend $150 billion on new and expanded fabs in Idaho, New York, and Virginia, alongside $50 billion for research and development, including high-bandwidth memory packaging.

Micron said it has secured federal, state, and local support for the projects, including up to $6.4 billion through the CHIPS and Science Act, and expects to benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit.

CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the expansion would strengthen U.S. tech leadership, create tens of thousands of jobs, and ensure supply chain resilience.

Micron shares were little changed Thursday but remain near a 12-month high, up 37% year to date.

Some readers may get the wrong impression that I am a Luddite.

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Luddites were members of organized bands of 19th-century English handicraftsmen who rioted against the use of textile machinery that was displacing them. The term is now used broadly to refer to people opposed to technological change.

I criticize artificial intelligence, but that doesn&#39;t mean I am against machine learning.

It can be used for good. Finding patterns in data that the human mind can&#39;t &#34;digest&#34; properly is very useful. It has already led to scientific breakthroughs.

Many recently launched supercomputer systems have been slapped with AI tags for marketing purposes, even if those supercomputers (hopefully) won&#39;t be used for useless stuff like chatbots.

And to mention the Luddites again, we hear every day how AI will replace humans in the workplace, or that it is already taking jobs.

More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off in 2024. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is Amazon, Google, Tesla, or Microsoft, tech companies are looking for ways to use AI, rather than humans, to generate as much code as possible.

Relying heavily on AI to generate code, or &#34;vibe coding,&#34; unfortunately, only works if a person can review the AI-generated slop.

AI will surely work if you are updating a website that has been made hundreds of times before. If you want to build something original, you&#39;ll have plenty of mistakes to fix.

I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t like fixing AI&#39;s mistakes. Even before AI, gigantic &#34;enterprise&#34; codebases were the topic of horror stories among programmers. These vibe-coded ones will make those codebases look great, if not impeccable.

When these vibe projects get stuck, the developers hired back to fix all the AI-generated code should request higher pay to deal with it.

The memory specialist also showed impressive financial performance as it saw its DRAM revenue reach $6.1 billion in fiscal Q2 2025, down about 4% from the prior quarter but up roughly 47% year on year. Company statements attribute the growth to high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and stronger data centre demand.

Micron expects the HBM total addressable market to grow from about $16 billion in 2024 to nearly $100 billion by 2030, implying roughly a 36% annual increase. Samples of its HBM4 36GB 12-high product have been shipped to key customers, with a volume ramp slated for 2026 to match next-gen AI platform needs.

Market watchers note Micron complements GPU makers by supplying crucial memory for AI workloads. While the stock rebound reflects optimism, future gains may depend on sustained HBM adoption and industry balance. Investors remain watchful of broader AI-driven demand and any shifts in trade relations.

Meanwhile, Analysts caution that margin expansion may hinge on supply discipline and pricing stability amid potential oversupply risks; Micron&#39;s capital investments in HBM could strain cash flow if demand falters, making vigilance on inventory levels and end-market consumption critical over time.

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">Micron (MU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this chipmaker have returned +21.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&#39;s +3.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 13.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company&#39;s business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company&#39;s future earnings over anything else. That&#39;s because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors&#39; interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Micron is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +153.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.

The consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +433.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.8 indicates a change of +55.9% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock&#39;s price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>

The plan calls for two new high-volume fabs in Idahoone slated to start DRAM production in 2027four more fabs in New York, and an expanded, modernized facility in Virginia, alongside advanced HBM packaging and research initiatives.

To finance the buildout, Micron has locked in $275 million under the CHIPS and Science Act and is eligible for up to $6.4 billion in direct funding for its Idaho and New York sites.

CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the move underscores our commitment to driving innovation and strengthening the domestic semiconductor industry, while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo added the investment will ensure the U.S. advances its lead across critical industries like AI, automotive, and aerospace and defense.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services chief Matt Garman praised the expansion as a significant milestone for the semiconductor industry. Even as shares dipped 0.21 percent on the news, analysts note that onshoring DRAM production could shorten supply chains, improve margin visibility and reduce geopolitical risk.

Why It Matters: With global memory demand surgingespecially for AI applicationssecuring a domestic production base could give Micron a strategic edge and help the U.S. lessen dependence on overseas fabs.

Additionally, Micron Technology has rebounded from earlier lows and now carries a 12-month price target of $121.82, suggesting a modest 5.26% upside. The projections vary widely, with a high-end forecast of $172 and a low of $60, signaling some uncertainty. After dipping below $70 earlier this year, the stock has climbed steadily and analysts seem cautiously optimistic moving forward.

The company is committing $150 billion to building and expanding memory fabs across Idaho, New York, and Virginia, along with $50 billion more toward research and development. In total, the effort is expected to create around 90,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly. According to Micron, the plan will help it meet growing demand while pushing to manufacture 40% of its DRAM chips on U.S. soil.

This isn&#39;t just a business moveit&#39;s a national strategy. Backed by the Trump administration, the announcement reinforces Washington&#39;s push to onshore critical technologies amid rising geopolitical risk. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called it a turning point, suggesting Micron&#39;s initiative could bolster key industries like AI, aerospace, and defense. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra framed it as a long-term play to &#34;strengthen the domestic semiconductor industry&#34; and cement American leadership in innovation. The first DRAM output from Idaho is on track for 2027, while groundwork in New York is expected to begin later this year.

Micron also expects these projects to qualify for the advanced manufacturing investment credita potential tailwind for its bottom line. While this doesn&#39;t guarantee short-term gains, it signals a structural shift in where and how advanced chips get made. With AI workloads rising fast and national security concerns top of mind, Micron&#39;s U.S.-based capacity buildout could be a critical piece in the next chapter of global tech power.

Micron Technology on Thursday announced a $200 billion investment to boost semiconductor production in the U.S.

Roughly $150 billion is scheduled to be used for fabs in three states and advanced high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities, and $50 billion for research and development.

Micron has secured federal, state, and local funding, which includes as much as $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act.



Micron Technology (MU) on Thursday became the latest major corporation to announce plans to expand domestic production following President Donald Trump&#39;s call for firms to boost American manufacturing.

The chipmaker and the Trump administration said Micron will boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development (R&amp;D).

Micron explained that most of the money would be used for &#34;two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia,&#34; as well as advanced high-bandwith memory (HBM) packaging capabilities.

The company noted that it has already received federal, state, and local funding for the Idaho, New York, and Virginia fab work, including up to $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron added it expects all of the investments will be eligible for federal Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC).

CEO Sanjay Mehrotra argued that this expansion &#34;will reinforce America&#39;s technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors—critical to economic and national security.&#34;

This week, General Motors (GM) announced it would spend $4 billion to increase vehicle production at three U.S. plants. Earlier this year, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) said it planned to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities, and Apple (AAPL) announced plans to spend more than $500 billion domestically over the next four years.

Shares of Micron Technology were little changed today but are up 37% this year, trading at their highest level since last July.

The move, in partnership with the Trump administration, includes $150 billion earmarked for manufacturing and $50 billion for research and development, and will create an estimated 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

The initiative expands Micron’s ambitions beyond previous plans by $30 billion, including the development of a second memory fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho, and the modernization of its plant in Manassas, Virginia. The company will also bring advanced packaging capabilities for High Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Memory (HBM) to the U.S., targeting growth fueled by AI adoption.

The expanded footprint includes up to six high-volume, leading-edge memory fabs across Idaho and New York. Micron aims to produce 40% of its DRAM in the U.S., reinforcing its competitive position amid rising demand for AI-related computing infrastructure.

Construction on Micron’s first fab in Idaho is already underway, with production slated to begin in 2027. The newly announced second fab will further increase DRAM output, while site preparation for the first New York facility is expected to commence this year once remaining regulatory reviews are complete.

“Micron’s U.S. memory manufacturing and R&amp;D plans underscore our commitment to driving innovation and strengthening the domestic semiconductor industry,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra stated. “This approximately $200 billion investment will reinforce America’s technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors—critical to economic and national security.”

The development has attracted endorsements from across industry, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two companies central to the AI hardware and software ecosystem. “Micron’s investment in advanced memory manufacturing and HBM capabilities in the U.S., with support from Trump Administration, is an important step forward for the AI ecosystem,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella added, “Strengthening semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. will drive new innovation, create high-skilled jobs, and further American competitiveness.

In addition to its manufacturing investment, Micron has committed over $325 million to workforce development initiatives in Idaho, New York, and Virginia. These efforts include academic partnerships, curriculum development, and training programs to ensure a stable pipeline of talent to support the company’s growth across critical technology sectors.</p>

The move brings Micron&#39;s total US manufacturing and R&amp;D investments up to roughly $200 billion, which would create some 90,000 direct and indirect jobs, the company said. Micron is receiving about $6.5 billion in funding from the US CHIPS and Science Act.

The plans call for Micron to build a second memory manufacturing plant at its Boise, Idaho, facility and a massive chip fabrication complex in New York. The company is also updating and expanding its Virginia plant.

Micron said it expects the second Idaho plant to help the company bring its advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing to the US. HBM is a key component in AI data centers.

&#34;Micron&#39;s investment in advanced memory manufacturing and HBM capabilities in the U.S., with support from the Trump Administration, is an important step forward for the AI ecosystem,&#34; Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

&#34;Micron&#39;s leadership in high-performance memory is invaluable to enabling the next generation of AI breakthroughs that NVIDIA is driving. We&#39;re excited to collaborate with Micron as we push the boundaries of what&#39;s possible in AI and high-performance computing,&#34; Huang added.

All totaled, Micron said the investments will allow the company to produce 40% of its DRAM memory in the US. Its initial Idaho plant is expected to begin pumping out the hardware in 2027. Micron also said it is set to begin preparing the ground for its New York facilities later this year.

&#34;This approximately $200 billion investment will reinforce America&#39;s technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors — critical to economic and national security,&#34; Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.

&#34;We are grateful for the support from President Trump, Secretary Lutnick and our federal, state, and local partners who have been instrumental in advancing domestic semiconductor manufacturing.&#34;

Micron isn&#39;t the only company bringing HBM production to the US. South Korea&#39;s SK Hynix is building a new HBM plant in Indiana as part of a $3.8 billion construction project.

The Trump administration, and the Biden administration before it, has made onshoring semiconductor manufacturing a key component of its domestic agenda as it seeks to wean the country off its dependence on foreign-made chips.</p>

Semiconductor maker Micron Technology plans to invest $200 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development capacity, the company announced Thursday. 

Micron will spend $150 billion to expand domestic memory manufacturing across its facilities in New York, Idaho and Virginia, as well as $50 billion on R&amp;D efforts.

The investment, expected to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs, includes a new $30 billion commitment to build a second fabrication plant in Boise, Idaho, expand Micron’s Manassas, Virginia, facility and grow high bandwidth memory packaging capacity.  

Micron, which finalized $6.2 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funding last December, is one of many awardees upping their investments as the Commerce Department pushes chipmakers for more aggressive financial commitments.

Micron was awarded $6.2 billion to expand its Idaho and New York facilities, as well as $275 million to expand and modernize its Manassas, Virginia, facility, which will begin later this year. While the larger chunk of funding was finalized in December, Micron disclosed in a securities filing that it had finalized the federal contract for the Virginia funding June 11. The company is among the first awardees to see a status change in funding since President Donald Trump took office. 

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during a congressional budget hearing last week that the department is &#34;renegotiating&#34; CHIPS funding contracts &#34;for the benefit of the American taxpayer.&#34;

The list of CHIPS awardees increasing their investments continues to grow. Last week, GlobalFoundries, which is set to receive $1.5 billion in CHIPS funding, announced an additional $3 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments. And in March, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., slated to receive $6.6 billion in CHIPS money, committed another $100 billion in U.S. investment.

Micron has announced several high-profile investments in recent years. In 2022, the company unveiled plans to invest $100 billion in Clay, New York over two decades to build the largest fabrication plant in the country. 

It&#39;s also in the midst of building a $25 billion fab in Boise, Idaho, which will be further expanded under the new investment. The company now plans to spend $30 billion to build a second memory fab in Boise, as well as further expand its Manassas, Virginia facility. </p>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Memory chip maker Micron Technology said on Thursday it is expanding its U.S. investments by $30 billion as President Donald Trump presses companies to boost U.S. investments and threatens new tariffs on semiconductors.

Micron now says its planned investments will total $200 billion. The company last year said it planned to invest around $100 billion in manufacturing in New York and $25 billion in Idaho.

In December, the U.S. Commerce Department under former President Joe Biden finalized a nearly $6.2 billion government subsidy for Micron to produce semiconductors in New York and Idaho, one of the largest government awards to chip companies under the $52.7 billion 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to kill the CHIPS act. His administration is renegotiating some of Biden&#39;s grants to semiconductor firms, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week.

AI chip leader and Micron customer Nvidia said in April it is planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years with help from partners such as Taiwan&#39;s TSMC.

Micron&#39;s additional investment will center around building a second leading-edge memory fab in Boise, Idaho, and expanding a manufacturing facility in Manassas, Virginia.

&#34;These investments are designed to allow Micron to meet expected market demand, maintain share and support Micron&#39;s goal of producing 40% of its DRAM in the U.S,&#34; the company said, referring to a type of widely employed memory chip.

DRAM chips are key components in personal computing, cars, industrial operations, wireless communications and artificial intelligence and Micron&#39;s High-Bandwidth Memory is critical for enabling new AI models, officials have said.

The company will also dedicate about $50 billion to R&amp;D, Micron said.

&#34;Micron&#39;s investment in advanced memory manufacturing and HBM capabilities in the U.S., with support from (the) Trump administration, is an important step forward for the AI ecosystem,&#34; Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.

Micron also said it finalized a $275 million direct funding award under the CHIPS Act to expand its Manassas facility.

                                                        <p class="text-secondary small mb-2">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM, also known as TSMC, is reinforcing its nanosheet chip technology roadmap with N2, N2P, and A16, which are aimed at extending performance and efficiency at advanced nodes. Out of these, the A16 advanced node has been specifically designed to accommodate high-performance computing (HPC) products and AI-class workloads. These advanced nodes are expected to extend TSMC’s technology leadership position and enable it to capture growth opportunities into the future.

Taiwan Semiconductor’s N2 logic node is the first generation of nanosheet transistor technology and offers 10-15% speed improvement, 25-30% power improvement, and more than 15% chip density gain when compared with N3E. The logic node is on track to enter volume production in the second half of 2025. Moreover, TSMC also expects the number of new tape-outs for N2, fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications, to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first two years.

Taiwan Semiconductor is winning important customers, such as AMD and Apple, for its new N2 advanced logic node. Apple plans to use these chips in future iPhones and Mac devices, while AMD wants to use them to make faster CPUs and GPUs to compete better in the market.

Introduced in the first quarter of 2025, N2P is an extension of the N2 family, which features improved performance and power efficiency. A16 is also a nanosheet-based technology with backside power delivery and is intended to be a logical upgrade to N2P. The A16 logic node, also introduced in the first quarter, is expected to deliver up to 15-20% power improvement and an additional 7-10% chip density gain when compared with N2P.

With fabs under construction in Taiwan and Arizona to support both N2 and A16 and volume production scheduled for N2P and A16 in the second half of 2025, Taiwan Semiconductor appears well-positioned to benefit from the next wave of AI and high-performance computing demand.

Two key competitors,  Intel INTC and GlobalFoundries GFS, are working hard to catch up with TSMC’s lead. Intel plans to launch its 2nm-based node, called Intel 18A, in the second half of 2025. Intel is focusing on new technologies like RibbonFET transistors and backside power delivery for its 18A node, similar to TSMC’s A16.

Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries is not focused on 2nm chips. Instead, it is investing in specialized chips for cars, wireless devices, and the IoTs. While GlobalFoundries does not directly compete with Taiwan Semiconductor at the most advanced nodes, it still aims to take market share in fast-growing chip segments.</p>

10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›

Tech stocks have been some of the best-performing stocks over the past decade. As a result, eight of the world&#39;s 10 most valuable public companies are now tech companies.

Admittedly, 2025 has gotten off to a rough start to 2025 for many of these top companies. Yet it&#39;s not time to panic. If anything, this is a time to scoop up some great companies that are trading at relative discounts.

If you&#39;re looking to add tech stocks to your portfolio, consider the following two companies. They&#39;re in good positions to return great long-term value.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), also referred to as TSMC, is one of the world&#39;s most important tech companies. It&#39;s the world&#39;s largest semiconductor foundry, with a market share in contract chipmaking space of around 67%.

For perspective, the second-largest semiconductor foundry is Samsung, which has a roughly 7% market share.

Instead of designing and producing its own semiconductors for general sale, TSMC manufactures chips on behalf of other companies. They come to TSMC with the designs, and it uses its top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities to bring those products to life. Its success with this model has made TSMC the go-to chip fabricator for well-known companies like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and dozens of others.

These high-dollar clients have treated TSMC well, too. In the first quarter, TSMC&#39;s revenue increased 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, and its cash from operations increased 43%. Both gains were continuations of impressive runs over the past five years.

The next few years should be lucrative: Management estimates that TSMC&#39;s revenue will grow at a compound annual rate of 20% from 2024 to 2029. If that forecast proves accurate, TSMC will be bringing in well over $200 billion by 2029.

Much of this optimism stems from the surging demand for AI-capable semiconductors as the broader AI boom continues. TSMC&#39;s high-performance computing (HPC) segment, which contains its AI-related semiconductors, accounted for 59% of the company&#39;s revenue in Q1. In Q1 2024, it was only 46%.</p>

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the world we live in. With the technology perhaps being a once-in-a-generation opportunity, it&#39;s not too late to invest in the stocks leading the AI charge.

Let&#39;s look at five leading AI stocks to buy right now.

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI by helping organizations actually put AI to work.

By gathering data and structuring it into an &#34;ontology,&#34; Palantir&#39;s AI platform (AIP) maps digital assets to real-world objects and processes to let customers apply AI to solve real-world problems. AIP is being used for a variety of tasks, from optimizing supply chains to automating underwriting to even monitoring for sepsis in hospitals.

While the company has long been an important government vendor, Palantir&#39;s growth is currently being powered by the U.S. public sector. Given the wide array of applications across industries that AIP can be used for, Palantir has a massive opportunity in front of it.

Recently, Palantir has introduced AI agents within AIP that go beyond analysis to take action. Agentic AI is becoming the next big AI push, and could be a big growth driver for the company.

That said, the stock isn&#39;t cheap, and government budget cuts could potentially impact growth. Still, Palantir&#39;s technology looks unmatched, and the company is well-positioned to be a long-term AI leader.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to be one of the top ways to invest in the AI infrastructure boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of AI data centers thanks to their powerful parallel processing capabilities. And as the engine that helps run AI workloads, demand for GPUs continues to soar as organizations race to build and run AI models and apps.

Nvidia&#39;s real moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform, which it created to make it easier for developers to program its chips. Since then, it has built a powerful suite of tools and libraries that further enhance its GPUs&#39; performance for AI workloads.

The tight integration between its powerful GPUs and CUDA helped Nvidia attain an over 90% share in the GPU market in Q1. Its new Blackwell chips are ramping up faster than any product in its history, and demand for its full-stack AI &#34;factories&#34; continues to surge. Beyond the data center, Nvidia is also gaining traction in the automotive space, with revenue expected to hit $5 billion this year.</p>

TSMC produces the chips that drive everything from Nvidia’s GPUs to Apple’s iPhones, and it’s now experiencing accelerated growth fueled by surging AI demand, global factory expansion, and massive capital investment. Despite its strong rebound and concerns about exuberant valuations, TSMC still appears attractively priced. Given how sharply TSM has bounced back, the stock could become the ultimate Tech play, with its best days still ahead.

Many tech giants are currently riding the AI wave, but when it comes to TSMC, it’s more appropriate to say that the company is steering it. As the world’s largest contract chipmaker, it produces the advanced processors that Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Apple (AAPL) rely on to bring AI to life. In TSMC’s latest earnings call in April, CEO C.C. Wei revealed that AI chip revenue, which tripled in 2024, is expected to double again this year.

This is currently a major tailwind for TSMC, driving a 41.6% year-over-year revenue surge. Specifically, advanced 3nm and 5nm chips, critical for AI’s heavy lifting, made up 73% of wafer sales. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) building AI data centers at breakneck speed, the company’s factories are running at full capacity, with no signs that demand is slowing down anytime soon.

In the meantime, with AI entering the sphere of national security, TSMC has been incentivized to not keep its magic in Taiwan. It’s spreading its wings to secure its AI dominance and sidestep geopolitical risks. The company is investing $165 billion in U.S. factories, with Arizona’s first fab already fully booked by heavyweights like Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM). Here’s how all these giants stack up on TipRanks’ stock comparison tool:

Moreover, in Europe, a new $10 billion plant in Dresden, Germany, and a chip design center in Munich are positioning TSMC to capture the continent’s growing AI market. Beyond the motive of diversifying supply chain and hedging geopolitical risk, TSMC has managed to secure long-term, high-value contracts with global tech titans through these moves, as they, in turn, can make such commitments with notably less risk involved.</p>

Micron Technology on Thursday announced a $200 billion investment to boost semiconductor production in the U.S.

Roughly $150 billion is scheduled to be used for fabs in three states and advanced high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities, and $50 billion for research and development.

Micron has secured federal, state, and local funding, which includes as much as $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act.



Micron Technology (MU) on Thursday became the latest major corporation to announce plans to expand domestic production following President Donald Trump&#39;s call for firms to boost American manufacturing.

The chipmaker and the Trump administration said Micron will boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development (R&amp;D).

Micron explained that most of the money would be used for &#34;two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia,&#34; as well as advanced high-bandwith memory (HBM) packaging capabilities.

The company noted that it has already received federal, state, and local funding for the Idaho, New York, and Virginia fab work, including up to $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron added it expects all of the investments will be eligible for federal Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC).

CEO Sanjay Mehrotra argued that this expansion &#34;will reinforce America&#39;s technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors—critical to economic and national security.&#34;

This week, General Motors (GM) announced it would spend $4 billion to increase vehicle production at three U.S. plants. Earlier this year, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) said it planned to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities, and Apple (AAPL) announced plans to spend more than $500 billion domestically over the next four years.

Shares of Micron Technology were little changed today but are up 37% this year, trading at their highest level since last July.

Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:

Intel Corp. stock plunged 70% post chip foundry venture, yet Lip-Bu Tan&#39;s appointment as new CEO and recent 10% stock rise hint at a potential turnaround. Is it a good buy now? Let&#39;s see.

Both Intel and NVIDIA Corp. produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA&#39;s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA&#39;s Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?).

Of course, it&#39;s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA&#39;s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel&#39;s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA&#39;s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips.

In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel&#39;s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., or TSMC, and Samsung.

However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel&#39;s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions.

Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.&#39;s $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback.</p>

In 2023, UTokyo adopted Taiwan Semiconductor’s 16nm FinFET process technology for chip design training.

Located on UTokyo’s Asano campus in the Hongo district, the Lab will be managed by UTokyo faculty and staff and guided by directors from both UTokyo and Taiwan Semiconductor. It will serve as a central hub for a Strategic Collaboration initiative.

The Lab will facilitate research in semiconductor technologies, with an emphasis on practical applications in the future. It will cover areas such as materials, devices, processes, metrology, packaging, and circuit design.

Additionally, the Lab will explore collaboration through activities such as Taiwan Semiconductor-sponsored project calls and internship opportunities.

Taiwan Semiconductor, along with its Japan Design Center, Japan 3DIC R&amp;D Center, and Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) specialty fab, will leverage the Lab to further its next-generation talent development.

Taiwan Semiconductor gained 24% in the last 12 months due to the AI frenzy prompting it to expand beyond Taiwan. However, the Trump administration’s tariff policies have hurt semiconductor companies.

However, last week, Taiwan Semiconductor CEO C.C. Wei blamed traffic jams for hampering the progress of its Tokyo signature chipmaking project. He also highlighted to President Donald Trump the difficulties in completing the Arizona project in five years due to the skilled labor crisis.

Taiwan Semiconductor’s plan to build a second factory in Japan’s Kumamoto Prefecture remains vulnerable to the sudden influx of workers from the contract chipmaker’s first plant, which is damaging the rural infrastructure.

Interestingly, the chipmaker’s prioritization of the U.S. expansion reduced the urgency of production in Japan.</p>

Once upon a time, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was a millionaire-maker stock. If you had invested $10,000 in its initial public offering (IPO) in 1971, it would be worth $10.3 million today. However, that investment briefly blossomed to $37.9 million when the stock closed at its record high on Aug. 28, 2000.

Yet Intel hasn&#39;t generated any millionaire-making gains since then. Over the past decade, the chipmaker struggled with market share losses to AMD in the x86 CPU market, persistent shortages and delays, and abrupt strategic shifts under four different CEOs. It couldn&#39;t leverage its dominance of the PC and server CPU markets to expand into the higher-growth mobile and AI chip markets, while its own foundries fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC for short) in the race to produce smaller and denser chips.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Intel&#39;s revenue to have an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% as the company&#39;s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, tries to bolster its engineering capabilities, develop more CPUs with integrated AI features, strengthen the foundry business, and streamline spending.

Analysts expect Intel to stay unprofitable in 2025 as it spins all those plates, but they expect it to turn profitable again in 2026 and grow its net income more than sevenfold in 2027.

That&#39;s an optimistic outlook, but Intel could struggle to balance the rollout of its latest 18A chips with its cost-cutting -- which includes the divestments of its noncore assets, layoffs, and its dependence on TSMC to manufacture some of its new 2nm CPUs.

The stock also still looks overvalued relative to its peers at 74 times its forward adjusted earnings. So instead of betting on Intel&#39;s eventual recovery, it might be smarter to stick with another millionaire-maker semiconductor stock with a brighter future: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).

Avago Technologies, the chipmaker that acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, went public in 2009 at a split-adjusted price of $1.50 per share. A $10,000 investment in that IPO would be worth $1.63 million today.

Prior to acquiring Broadcom, Avago produced a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio frequency chips. The original Broadcom competed against Avago in the storage and networking markets, but it also sold a wider variety of mobile, multimedia, and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips. By combining those two businesses, the &#34;new&#34; Broadcom supplied a diverse mix of essential chips for its enterprise, industrial, and mobile customers.</p>

Still, that doesn’t stop me from seeing the stock as a long-term Buy—especially since my bullishness comes from Qualcomm’s key competitive advantage: its ability to build the Snapdragon platform, which integrates a modem, CPU, and even a GPU chip—something no other competitor can currently match. This positions the company to tap into new business opportunities that could help offset its current customer concentration.

Beyond that, Qualcomm’s asset-light model allows it to generate very high returns on its investments, highlighting its operational efficiency, strong financial health, and consistent value creation for shareholders. This helps justify the company trading at a slightly stretched valuation when considering its operational profits relative to enterprise value.

When looking for value stocks, one of the most important factors—if not the most important—is a company’s ability to generate consistent earnings. Examining QCOM’s balance sheet reveals a capital-light, high-margin model driven by intellectual property (IP) and characterized by heavy investment in research and development (R&amp;D).

As a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm relies on external manufacturing partners such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) for chip production. Notably, only approximately 7% of its $55.3 billion in total assets is allocated to property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E), which is relatively low compared to the industry average. This underscores the efficiency of its asset-light business model and the minimal physical infrastructure required to support its operations.

Roughly 18% of its assets are classified as goodwill, indicating a strong track record of acquisitions, which is clearly part of its strategy to acquire intellectual property (IP) or talent rather than build everything in-house. One recent example is the $2.4 billion acquisition of the UK-based semiconductor firm Alphawave.</p>

On June 10, the company reported its May revenue, which surged 40% year-over-year to NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) as demand remained high for its AI chips.

The contract chipmaker, which supplies to tech giants such as Apple and Nvidia, had its revenue up 39.6% from a year earlier but down 8% from April’s figure. According to TSMC’s CEO C.C. Wei, April softening was seasonal, and the company is ramping advanced nodes to ease bottlenecks. Its capacity expansions in Arizona and Taiwan are progressing according to plan. Moreover, new EUV tools and packaging lines are launching to boost throughput for the latest H100 and next-gen Gaudi GPUs.

Back in March, Wei joined President Donald Trump in announcing his intent to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip-manufacturing facilities. He acknowledged TSMC’s projection of “full-year 2025 revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms” in the company’s first-quarter earnings call in April.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications.

Nvidia  (NVDA)  stock may be poised for another rally after a bullish revenue surprise from one of its key partners in the AI supply chain.

On June 10, Taiwan Semiconductor  (TSM) , the world’s largest chip foundry and a critical manufacturer for Nvidia, reported May revenue of NT$320.52 billion (about $10.70 billion), up 39.6% from a year earlier but down 8% from April’s figure.

Despite the sequential dip, May still marked TSMC’s second-highest monthly revenue on record, behind only April 2025, which likely benefited from accelerated orders ahead of potential tariffs from President Trump’s administration.

TSMC’s revenue for January through May 2025 increased by 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024, signaling that demand for AI chips is strong even amid macro uncertainty.

That bodes well for Nvidia, which relies heavily on TSMC to manufacture its high-performance AI GPUs.

Nvidia was among the tech stocks hit hard in early April as tariff tensions flared and the U.S. tightened export restrictions on advanced chips. The company took a $4.5 billion charge in the fiscal first quarter ended April 27 and said it would have recorded an additional $2.5 billion in revenue without the restriction.

The stock later rebounded after the U.S. and China agreed to slash tariff rates on each other temporarily. Optimism also grew after the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, another export control on advanced AI chips.

News that Nvidia will supply AI chips to Saudi Arabia’s Humain, an emerging tech player in the region, also boosted the stock.

On May 28, Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter results. Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share on $44.06 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter surpassed Wall Street’s expectations of 93 cents and $43.31 billion.

The company forecasts $45 billion, missing analysts’ projections of $45.9 billion. But it noted that the figure would have been roughly $8 billion higher without the China export curbs.

Tensions between China and the U.S. remain the Damocles’ sword hanging over Nvidia. Investors are now focused on the second round of U.S.-China trade talks, which is taking place in London. If the world’s two largest economies fail to reach a trade deal, it could hit Nvidia’s bottom line.</p>

Both Intel and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA’s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA&#39;s Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?).

Of course, it’s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA’s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel’s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA’s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips.

In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel’s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, or TSMC, and Samsung.

However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel’s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions.

Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback.

Last but not least, Lip-Bu Tan’s appointment as the CEO of Intel has been well-received by market pundits, as his stint in the semiconductor industry has been productive. Tan’s initiatives to streamline operations, deliver a competitive AI platform, and spin-off assets would restore stability at Intel and help the company return to its past glory. 

With Lip-Bu Tan leading Intel’s foundry recovery and AI accelerators gaining ground among competitors through cost advantages, holding onto INTC stock seems judicious. Intel’s business revival is becoming more probable, and brokers are showing optimism by increasing the short-term price target for INTC to $22.42 (up 9.5%) from $20.48. The highest target is $62, indicating a potential 202.7% upside.</p>

The high demand for these chips has led to Micron’s HBM revenues crossing $1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, marking a major milestone.

Since Micron’s HBM3E and HBM3E-12H variants offer significant power reduction in comparison to its competitors while also delivering higher memory capacity, customers have already placed a large demand for these products, resulting in Micron being fully sold out of its HBM supply for calendar 2025.

The HBMs developed by Micron have a total addressable market estimate of more than $35 billion for the calendar year 2025. Now the company is focusing on HBM delivery agreements for 2026. It is worth noting that the largest AI-chip manufacturer, NVIDIA NVDA, announced in January 2025 that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. NVIDIA has installed Micron’s HBM3E 8H chips inside the NVIDIA GB200 system and HBM3E 12H chips in NVIDIA GB300.

To top it all off, Micron is developing the next generation of high bandwidth memory, HBM4, which will increase the bandwidth by more than 60% compared to HBM3E. The company will ramp the production volume of HBM4 in 2026. With Micron experiencing a sequential surge of 50% in HBM revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and considering its future plans, it is quite evident that momentum in HBMs will persist.

Micron anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $8.80 billion (+/-$200 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter fiscal 2025 is pegged at $8.81 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 29.33%.

The global HBM market is highly consolidated, with a handful of players in this space. Companies, including SK hynix, TSMC TSM and Samsung, exist in this space. However, not all of them compete directly against Micron.

While SK Hynix and Samsung develop their own HBM2E, HBM3, and HBM3E, TSMC develops HBM packages based on SK Hynix’s HBMs. In 2024, SK hynix and TSMC collaborated to collectively develop HBM4 and next-generation packaging technology.

This collaboration has led SK hynix to adopt TSMC’s foundry process to develop its HBM4, showcased for the first time in April 2025. Since the HBM space has a few capable players and huge growth opportunities, this provides a strong growth opportunity for Micron.</p>

CoreWeave has nearly quadrupled since its heavily downsized initial public offering in March. Palantir is up more than 460% over the past year. Investors may hope that the shares will perform like Nvidia Corp., whose stock soared at the start of the artificial intelligence era. The risk is that they act more like retailer GameStop Corp. — now 66% below a 2021 peak.

“Investors are ignoring fundamentals just to jump on the trend, and if you stretch a rubber band, the snapback can be substantial,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers Group. “You need fresh money to reinforce the trend, otherwise the moves aren’t sustainable.”

Shares of CoreWeave fell 5.8% on Tuesday while Palantir slipped 0.4%.

Hints of such risks came last week, when cloud-computing provider CoreWeave tumbled 17% out of the blue, its biggest one-day drop on record. The shares since recovered and neared a fresh high on Monday.

CoreWeave and Palantir are among this year’s best-performing stocks amid a resurgence of the AI trade as tech giants continue to spend heavily on computing infrastructure. CoreWeave rents cloud-computing capacity and counts Microsoft Corp. as one of its biggest customers. Palantir makes data analysis software used by governments and commercial customers.

Representatives for CoreWeave and Palantir did not immediately respond to Bloomberg News requests for comment.

In contrast to GameStop, a video-game retailer that faced real challenges during the pandemic, both are clearly benefiting from strong demand for their services. CoreWeave’s revenue is expected to more than double this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Palantir’s is projected to increase by 36%, aided by brisk sales of its AI offerings.

The problem is whether investors are over-paying for that growth. Palantir trades at 71 times estimated sales, making it by far the most expensive stock in the S&amp;P 500. CoreWeave, which had a net loss of $315 million in the first quarter, is priced at 10 times projected sales. The average in the S&amp;P 500 is around 3 times.</p>

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock&#39;s price, do they really matter?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let&#39;s see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM).

TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.7% and 18.2% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying TSMC, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.

Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five &#34;Strong Buy&#34; recommendations for every &#34;Strong Sell&#34; recommendation.

In other words, their interests aren&#39;t always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock&#39;s price movement.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock&#39;s near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.</p>

One headline piece, rolled out in Cupertino, California was new capabilities for the tech giant&#39;s iPads, which will allow users to use the tablet less like an iPhone and more like a laptop.

The updates include the ability to use windowed versions of apps that you can move and resize just as you would on a Mac. Previously, apps could only be resized in certain instances and and apps snapped to specific areas of the iPad&#39;s screen.

Now, you&#39;ll be able to layer apps on top of each other and have even more of them slightly offscreen to make room for other apps.

Apple also added a new menu bar at the top of the iPad&#39;s screen where you can access options like app-specific commands, similar to the Mac. The company also updated its Files app, so you can navigate your saved documents, videos, and photos more easily. And Apple is finally bringing the Preview app to the iPad for when you need to quickly access a PDF file or photo.

Apple&#39;s iPad segment is its smallest business, bringing in $26.6bn (£19.7bn) of the company&#39;s $391bn in total revenue in 2024, down 6% year over year. The iPhone brought in $201.1 billion, while the Mac generated $29.9bn. The software update, however, could give consumers a bigger reason to choose an iPad over a MacBook Air, helping to goose sales.

Stock traded 1.2% lower ahead of the opening bell.

Tesla (TSLA) stock looked set to build on gains from Monday in premarket trade, with its highly anticipated robotaxi test set to begin on 12 June in Austin, Texas.

Weakness in the stock comes after the fallout between CEO Elon Musk and US president Trump, which does not show any signs of improving, at least for now.

Last week, Tesla stock dipped nearly 15% and saw more than $150bn in market cap erased after Musk slammed Trump&#39;s GOP-backed spending bill, prompting fiery responses from the president and raising concerns over the political risk now tied to the EV maker due to the actions of its chief executive.

While Trump allayed some concerns over his relationship with Musk on Friday, the president told NBC News over the weekend that he had &#34;no intention&#34; of speaking to Musk in the near future.

Shares rose as much as 2.6% in premarket, having jumped 4.6% in the previous session.</p>

(NYSE:TSM) posted a sharp rise in May sales as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications stayed strong, even as month-to-month figures dipped.

The world&#39;s largest contract chipmaker brought in NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) last month, up about 40% from a year earlier. The figure marked a slowdown from April&#39;s 48% annual jump and was down 8% sequentially.

The May total pushed revenue for the first five months of 2025 to NT$1.51 trillion, a 43% increase from the same period last year.

TSMC, which supplies key components to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is benefiting from persistent AI-related orders. Clients are reportedly building inventory in anticipation of potential disruptions tied to global trade uncertainty.

Analysts now expect TSMC&#39;s second-quarter revenue to rise more than 50% from the year-ago period, pointing to a strong pipeline despite short-term volatility.

CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei reiterated last week that demand for the company&#39;s AI chips remains ahead of supply, and he expects revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025.

Based on the one year price targets offered by 17 analysts, the average target price for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd is $218.45 with a high estimate of $265.34 and a low estimate of $119.37. The average target implies a upside of +5.53% from the current price of $207.00.

Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd in one year is $215.93, suggesting a upside of +4.31% from the current price of $207.00.
